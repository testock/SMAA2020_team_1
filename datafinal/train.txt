that O

not O

and O
that O

was O
without O

to O

on O
her O

the O
appointment O

that O

that O
therefore O

by O

of O
his O
right O
under O

, O
he O
prayed O

The O

request O
by O
Mrs. O
Minnie O

, O
a O

of O
the O

for O

On O

the O

denied O

The O
question O
for O
our O
determination O
is O
whether O
the O

as O

, O
had. O
*403the O
right O
under O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
statute O

and O
on O

Neither O
the O
petition O

the O
stipulated O
facts O
raise O
any O
question O
about O
the O
competency O
of O
the O
appellee O
to O
act O
as O
administrator. O
The O
provisions O
of O
the O
statute O
concerning O
preference O
in O
administering O
upon O
the O
estate O
of O
a O
deceased O

are O
contained O
in O
section O

[Cahill\u2019s O
Ill. O

, O
and O
are O
as O
follows: O
\u201c1st. O
To O

To O
the O
next O
of O

any O

\u201c9th. O
To O
the O
public O
administrator O
or O
to O
any O
creditor O
who O
shall O
apply O
for O
the O
same.\u201d O
It O
will O
be O
noticed O
that O
in O
the O
preference O
provided O
for O
by O
section O
18 O
, O
the O
public O
administrator O
comes O
after O
the O
next O
of O
kin O
of O
the O
deceased O
, O
in O
his O
right O
of O
appointment. O
In O
Dupee O
v. O
Follett O
, O
304 O
Ill. O
166 O
, O
which O
is O
the O
latest O
expression O
of O
the O
Supreme O
Court O
in O
the O
construction O
of O
section O
18 O
, O
and O
its O
preferential O
features O
, O
and O
the O
rights O
of O
a O
public O
administrator O
to O
administer O
upon O
intestate O
estates O
, O
the O
court O
says: O
\u201cThe O
statute O
contemplates O
the O
public O
administrator O
shall O
act O
when O
*404an O
intestate O
leaves O
property O
in O
this O
State O
and O
there O
is O
no O
relative O
or O
creditor O
within O
this O
State O
who O
will O
administer. O
If O
the O
deceased O
leaves O
relatives O
in O
this O
State O
who O
will O
administer O
and O
they O
seek O
to O
do O
so O
before O
the O
public O
administrator O
is O
appointed O
, O
they O
have O
a O
right O
to O
do O
so O
, O
even O
though O
they O
did O
not O
attempt O
to O
exercise O
that O
right O
within O
sixty O
days. O
The O
reason O
for O
creating O
the O
office O
of O
public O
administrator O
was O
to O
give O
authority O
to O
someone O
to O
administer O
on O
intestate O
estates O
where O
no O
relative O
or O
creditor O
would O
administer. O
If O
administration O
is O
required O
to O
conserve O
the O
estate O
and O
relatives O
and O
creditors O
of O
the O
deceased O
will O
not O
administer O
, O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
the O
public O
administrator O
to O
do O
so. O
The O
office O
was O
created O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
such O
estates O
, O
and O
if O
the O
heirs O
apply O
for O
letters O
of O
administration O
before O
application O
is O
made O
to O
commit O
the O
administration O
to O
the O
public O
administrator O
, O
* O
* O
* O
letters O
should O
be O
granted O
to O
them O
or O
to O
the O
person O
they O
nominate. O
It O
is O
the O
clear O
intent O
of O
the O
legislature O
that O
relatives O
and O
creditors O
of O
the O
intestate O
should O
be O
preferred O
to O
the O
public O
administrator.\u201d O
It O
is O
alleged O
in O
appellant\u2019s O
petition O
, O
and O
insisted O
on O
in O
the O
argument O
of O
his O
counsel O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Della O
Finfrock O
is O
not O
a O
next O
of O
kin. O
Next O
of O
kin O
are O
the O
nearest O
blood O
relatives. O
29 O
Cyc. O
1044. O
And O
the O
next O
of O
kin O
contemplated O
by O
the O
statute O
are O
the O
next O
of O
kin O
or O
nearest O
blood O
relatives O
of O
a O
deceased O
which O
come O
after O
the O
sisters O
and O
grandchildren O
, O
which O
in O
this O
case O
would O
mean O
the O
first O
cousins O
, O
namely O
, O
Della O
Finfrock O
and O
Mrs. O
Minnie O
Nugent. O
It O
is O
also O
contended O
that O
the O
next O
of O
kin O
referred O
to O
by O
the O
statute O
means O
next O
of O
kin O
who O
inherit O
the O
estate O
or O
have O
some O
interest O
therein. O
It-is O
a O
sufficient O
answer O
to O
this O
contention O
, O
we O
think O
, O
to O
point O
out O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
statute O
makes O
no O
such O
qualification; O
it O
does O
not O
discriminate O
between O
next O
of O
kin O
who O
inherit O
and O
those O
who O
do O
not O
inherit. O
For O
the O
reasons O
stated O
, O
we O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
there O
was O
no O
error O
in O
denial O
of O
the O
prayer O
of O
appellant\u2019s O
petition O
and O
striking O
it O
from O
the O
files. O
The O
mere O
re*405quest O
of O
one O
of O
the O
two O
next O
of O
kin O
for O
the O
appointment O
of O
the O
public O
administrator O
, O
after O
appellee O
had O
been O
appointed O
and O
qualified O
, O
we O
think O
, O
would O
not O
add O
any O
additional O
legal O
force O
to O
the O
appellant\u2019s O
right O
to O
be O
appointed; O
a O
different O
question O
, O
however O
, O
would O
have O
arisen O
if O
Mrs. O
Minnie O
Nugent O
would O
have O
asked O
to O
be O
appointed O

that O
, O
at O
the O
time O

the O

State O
referred O
to O
was O
in O
complete O
control O
of O
the O
improvements O
which O
were O
being O
made O
, O
and O
that O
consequently O
, O
if O
an O
unsafe O
condition O
in O
the O
highway O
and O

to O
the O

, O
existed O
, O
the O

The O
fact O
that O

under O

was O
in O

The O
only O
questions O
in O
this O
case O
are O
whether O
the O
circuit O
court O
has O
the O
jurisdiction O
to O
issue O
an O
injunction O
under O
the O
law O
of O
this O
State O
, O
where O
it O
is O
claimed O
the O
*343legislature O
had O
provided O
ample O
and O
adequate O
remedy O
through O
a O
Commerce O
Commission O
, O
and O
whether O
a O
complaining O
utility O
company O
, O
having O
appeared O
before O
the O
Commerce O
Commission O
, O
can O
go O
into O
the O
circuit O
court O
and O
have O
an O
injunction O
issued O
. O
Appellant O
had O
not O
obtained O
a O
certificate O
of O
necessity O
and O
convenience O
, O
as O
required O
by O
law O
, O
but O
was O
operating O
in O
violation O
of O
law. O

, O
the O
court O
said O
in O
a O
case O
involving O
a O
construction O
of O
the O
Public O
Utilities O
Act: O
\u201cWe O
are O
disposed O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
proposition O
of O
appellant O
that O
a O
private O
corporation O
lawfully O
operating O
a O
public O
utility O
may O
have O
an O
injunction O
against O
another O
private O
corporation O
, O
operating O
without O
authority O
of O
law O
, O
a O
similar O
utility O
which O
competes O
with O
and O
injures O
the O

This O
would O
seem O
to O
dispose O
of O
the O
first O
contention O
. O
It O
is O
undoubtedly O
true O
that O
when O
two O
tribunals O
have O
concurrent O
jurisdiction O
the O
one O
which O
first O
acquired O
jurisdiction O
will O
retain O
it O
to O
the O
exclusion O
of O
the O
other O
, O
if O
the O
one O
first O
obtaining O
jurisdiction O
furnishes O
a O
complete O
and O
adequate O
remedy O
in O
the O
premises. O
The O
Commerce O
Commission O
is O
not O
a O
court O
and O
appellant O
being O
engaged O
in O
operating O
without O
a O
certificate O
of O
necessity O
and O
convenience O
, O
the O
Commerce O
Commission O
had O
no O
power O
by O
order O
or O
process O
to O
furnish O
appellee O
with O
a O
complete O
and O
adequate O
remedy. O
When O
a O
legal O
remedy O
is O
available O
, O
equity O
will O
take O
jurisdiction O
if O
its O
remedy O
is O
more O
direct O
to O
the O
point O
and O
will O
avoid O
circuity O
of O
action. O
Trainor\u2019s O

The O
only O
method O
by O
which O
the O
Commerce O
Commission O
could O
enforce O
any O
order O
which O
it O
might O
make O
in O
the O

would O
be O
to O

$1 O
, O
500 O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
appellee O
, O
Clarence O
G. O
Martini O
, O
and O
against O
the O
appellant O
, O
the O
City O
of O
Grafton. O
The O
appellee O
bases O
his O
right O
of O
recovery O
upon O
the O
alleged O
negligence O
of O
the O
city O
in O
installing O
and O
maintaining O
an O
iron O
grating O
to O
cover O
a O
sewer O
opening O
at O
the O
northeast O
corner O
of O
Main O
and O
Vine O
streets. O
This O
grating O
which O
was O
placed O
there O
by O
the O
city O
is O
situated O
in O
the O
gutter O
, O
along O
the O
northerly O
side O
of O
Main O
street O
, O
and O
was O
put O
in O
position O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
preventing O
debris O
floating O
along O
the O
gutter O
from O
getting O
into O
the O
sewer. O
It O
was O
not O
fastened O
, O
and O
it O
is O
alleged O
that O
it O
was O
negligently O
maintained O
by O
the O
city O
in O
that O
loose O
and O
unfastened O
condition. O
The O
iron O
grating O
was O
set O
in O
the O
gutter O
over O
the O
sewer O
opening O
against O
the O
flagstone O
at O
the O
crosswalk. O
The O
crosswalk O
was O
used O
by O
pedestrians O
in O
crossing O
over O
Main O
street. O
When O
the O
grating O
was O
set O
in O
at O
the O
proper O
angle O
, O
namely O
, O
about O
forty O
or O
fifty O
degrees O
, O
the O
top O
of O
the O
grating O
would O
be O
on O
a O
level O
with O
the O
top O
of O
the O
flagstone O
walk O
, O
but O
apparently O
it O
could O
be O
shifted O
to O
a O
more O
acute O
angle O
, O
which O
might O
cause O
it O
to O
stick O
up O
over O
the O
level O
of O
the O
crosswalk O
and O
the O
sidewalk. O
The O
testimony O
of O
the O
appellee O
is O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
in O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
18th O
day O
of O
July O
, O
1920 O
, O
he O
and O
some O
other O
young O
men O
were O
passing O
through O
the O
City O
of O
Grafton O
on O
their O
way O
home O
to O
Alton O
, O
Illinois O
, O
but O
stopped O
over O
at O
Grafton O
to O
have O
some O
repairs O
made O
on O
the O
automobile O
, O
also O
to O
get O
some O
refreshments. O
After O
placing O
the O
automobile O
in O
a O
garage O
they O
walked O
over O
to O
a O
restaurant O
on O
Main O
street O
, O
got O
something O
to O
eat O
, O
and O
then O
on O
their O
way O
back O
to O
the O
garage O
where O
the O
ear O
had O
been O
left O
for O
repairs O
, O
while O
in O
the O
act O
of O
crossing O
Main O
street O
for O
that O
purpose O
at O
the O
corner O
referred O
to O
, O
the O
appellee O
alleges O
he O
was O
tripped O
up O
and O
stumbled O
over O
the O
grating O
, O
which O
, O
he O
testified O
, O
was O
sticking O
up O
above O
the O
level O
of O
the O
side*508walk O
and O
crosswalk. O
He O
fell O
upon O
the O
grating O
and O
sustained O
severe O
injuries. O
It O
is O
urged O
, O
in O
reversal O
of O
the O
judgment O
, O
that O
the O
verdict O
is O
contrary O
to O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
evidence O
, O
and O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
giving O
appellee\u2019s O
first O
instruction; O
also O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
the O
refusal O
of O
some O
of O
the O
instructions O
requested O
by O
the O
appellant. O
The O
instruction O
complained O
of O
, O
refers O
the O
jury O
to O
the O
declaration O
for O
a O
statement O
of O
the O
negligence O
upon O
which O
the O
appellee O
bases O
his O
right O
to O
recover O
, O
which O
has O
been O
repeatedly O
condemned; O
and O
the O
instruction O
is O
deficient O
in O
its O
statement O
of O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
liability O
of O
the O
city. O
The O
jury O
were O
told O
by O
this O
instruction O
that O
the O
City O
of O
Grafton O
was O
bound O
to O
use O
reasonable O
care O
and O
precaution O
to O
keep O
and O
maintain O
its O
streets O

in O

condition O
, O
to O
render O
them O
reasonably O
safe O
for O
all O
persons O
passing O
on O
or O

the O

While O
the O
abstract O
proposition O
of O
law O
, O
that O
the O
city O
was O
bound O
to O
use O
reasonable O
care O
in O
keeping O
and O
maintaining O
its O
streets O
in O
a O
safe O
condition O
, O
was O
not O
inaccurate O
, O
the O
instruction O
had O
a O
tendency O
to O
mislead O
the O
jury O
to O
the O
conclusion O
that O
the O
city O
was O
legally O
bound O
to O
keep O
its O
streets O
and O
sidewalks O
in O
a O
reasonably O
safe O
condition O
for O
all O
persons O
passing O
on O
or O
over O
the O
same O
regardless O
of O
the O
legal O
requirement O
of O
the O
exercise O
of O
due O
care O
and O
caution O
in O
the O
use O
of O
such O
streets O
and O
sidewalks; O
and O
the O
erroneous O
and O
misleading O
impression O
as O
to O
the O
law O
which O
the O
jury O
would O
likely O
receive O
from O
the O
instruction O
by O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
general O
principle O
was O
not O
cured O
by O
the O
disjointed O
addition O
to O
the O
instruction O
made O
at O
the O
end: O
\u201cAnd O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
Clarence O
Martini O
, O
sustained O
damages O
thereby O
without O
negligence O
or O
want O
of O
care O
on O
his O
part. O
\u2019 O
\u2019 O
The O
additional O
statement O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
instruction O
did O
not O
correct O
the O
erroneous O
impression O
which O
the O
jury O
would O
receive O
concerning O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
question. O
The O
requirement O
of O
reasonable O
care O
and O
caution O
should O
have O
been O
clearly O
stated O
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
basis O
of O
liability O
of O
the O
city O
un*509der O
the O
rule. O
The O
exercise O
of O
due O
care O
arid O
caution O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
appellee O
was O
one O
of O
the O
vital O
and O
controverted O
points O
at O
issue O
in O
the O
case O
, O
and O
the O
instruction O
must O
therefore O
be O
regarded O
as O
reversible O
error. O
We O
find O
no O
error O
in O
the O
refusal O
of O
the O
instruction O
requested O
by O
the O
appellant. O
All O
the O
matters O
which O
the O
appellant O
was O
entitled O
to O
in O
the O
refused O
instruction O
were O
covered O
by O
other O
instructions O
given O
in O
its O
behalf. O
We O
refrain O
from O
discussing O
the O
other O
point O
made O
by O
the O
appellant O
concerning O
the O
weight O
and O
effect O
of O
the O
evidence O
, O
inasmuch O
as O
the O
case O
will O
have O
to O

, O
a O

under O

of O

upon O

Afterwards O
on O

, O

, O
the O

made O
a O
motion O
to O

from O

It O
seems O
to O
be O
conceded O
that O
on O
October O

, O

, O
the O

had O
a O
judgment O
against O

on O

\u2014 O
this O

on O
motion O

vacated O

*166Nothing O
further O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
done O
in O
the O
matter O
until O
more O
than O
two O
years O
had O
elapsed O
, O
when O
on O
January O
13 O
, O
1921 O
, O
plaintiff O
went O
into O
court O
in O
the O
same O
suit O
and O
filed O
what O
is O
designated O
an O
amended O
statement O
of O
claim O
and O
cognovit. O
Upon O
the O
filing O
of O
it O
and O
on O
the O
same O
day O
the O
judgment O
for O
$6 O
, O
118.99 O
was O
entered O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
against O
the O
defendant O
, O
which O
the O
defendant O
sought O
to O
have O
vacated O
some O
nineteen O
months O
later O
, O
and O
it O
is O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
appeal O
from O
the O
order O
of O
the O
court O
denying O
his O
motion O
that O
is O
before O
us O
. O
The O
defendant O
contends O
that O
the O
judgment O
which O
he O
sought O
to O
have O
set O
aside O
by O
his O
motion O
was O
void O
because O
the O
power O
to O
confess O
the O
judgment O
on O
the O
notes O
was O
exhausted O
when O
the O
first O
judgment O
was O
entered. O
His O
position O
as O
stated O
by O
his O
counsel O
is: O
\u201cWhen O
a O
valid O
judgment O
has O
once O
been O
entered O
on O
a O
judgment O
note O
, O
the O
power O
to O
confess O
is O
exhausted O
, O
and O
no O
second O
judgment O
can O
be O
entered O
in O
such O
not\u00e9.\u201d O
None O
of O
the O
cases O

and O
we O

them. O
In O
the O
Hoyt O
case O
, O
judgment O
was O
entered O
by O
confession O
under O
a O
warrant O
of O
attorney O
on O
a O
note O
made O
by O
the O
defendants. O
Afterwards O
the O
defendants O
moved O
the O
court O
to O
vacate O
the O
judgment O
and O
supported O
their O
motion O
by O
an O
affidavit O
, O
which O
recited O
that O
a O
judgment O
had O
been O
confessed O
and O
entered O
on O
the O
same O
note O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Marshall O
county O
, O
which O
judgment O
was O
on O
motion O
of O
the O
defendant O
in O
that O
court O
vacated O
and O
set O
aside O
and O
the O
suit O
dismissed. O
Upon O
this O
showing O
the O
trial O
court O
set O
aside O
the O
judgment O
, O
holding O
that O
the O
power O
to O
confess O
judgment O
was O
exhausted O
by O
the O
entry O
of O
the O
judgment O
on O
the O
notes O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Marshall O
county. O
This O
was O
held O
to O
be O
error O
on O
appeal O
, O
this O
court O
holding O
that O
the O
warrant O
of O
attorney O
which O
authorized O
the O
confession O
of O
a O
judgment O
was O
not O
exhausted O
by O
the O
entry O
of O
a O
former O
judgment O
under O
the O
same O
warranty O
where O
*167the O
first O
judgment O
was O
set O
aside; O
that O
before O
a O
warranty O
of O
attorney O
could O
be O
said O
to O
have O
exhausted O
its O
power O
, O
it O
must O
appear O
that O
a O
valid O
judgment O
was O
entered O
by O
virtue O
of O
it. O
The O
court O
there O
said O
on O
page O
322: O
\u201cThe O
warrant O
of O
attorney O
was O
authority O
to O
confess O
a O
valid O
judgment. O
When O
the O
judgment O
which O
was O
attempted O
was O
vacated O
as O
invalid O
, O
the O
warrant O
had O
not O
functioned O
but O
retained O
its O
original O
potency. O
It O
clearly O
could O
not O
have O
exhausted O
its O
authority O
by O
an O
attempt O
which O
was O
a O
nullity. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
warrant O
of O
attorney O
must O
have O
been O
served O
before O
it O
could O
be O
said O
to O
be O
exhausted O
by O
its O
exercise O
, O

In O
the O
latter O
authority O
it O
is O
said: O
\u201cA O
warrant O
which O
authorizes O
the O
attorney O
to O
confess O
a O
judgment O
or O
judgments O
authorizes O
a O
second O
judgment O
only O
where O
the O
first O
one O
is O
imperfect O
and O
not O
where O
a O
valid O
and O
subsisting O
judgment O
has O
previously O
been O
confessed O
on O
the O
warrant. O
But O
where O
a O
judgment O
entered O
under O
the O
warrant O
has O
been O
set O
aside O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
death O
of O
the O
grantee O
, O
this O
does O
not O
prevent O
a O
second O
judgment O
being O
entered O
thereon O
in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
administrator.\u201d O
Counsel O
for O
the O
defendant O
seeks O
to O
distinguish O
the O
Hoyt O
case O
from O
the O
case O
at O
bar O
, O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
in O
the O
Hoyt O
case O
the O
first O
judgment O
was O
vacated O
on O
motion O
of O
the O
defendant O
, O
while O
in O
the O
case O
before O
us O
the O
first O
judgment O
was O
vacated O
on O
motion O
of O
the O
plaintiff. O
We O
think O
this O
difference O
in O
the O
facts O
does O
not O
affect O
the O
question O
before O
us. O
In O
the O
instant O
case O
there O
being O

one O
valid O
judgment O
entered O
under O
the O
warranty O
of O

, O
and O
that O
being O
the O
second O
judgment O
, O
it O
is O
not O
void O

One O
C. O
W. O
Witherspoon O
of O
Hillsboro O
had O
authority O
from O
appellee O
with O
reference O

but O
he O
had O
no O
authority O
in O
any O
manner O
to O

Appellants O
took O
possession O
of O
the O
premises O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
terms O
of O
said O
lease O
and O
used O
the O
same O
for O
a O
garage O
and O
other O
purposes O
for O
some O
time O
, O
but O
just O
how O
long O
is O
very O
indefinite O
from O

Some O
time O
after O
appellants O
took O
possession O
of O
the O
premises O
the O
business O
relations O
of O
Karnes O
and O
Ware O
were O
dissolved O
and O
Karnes O
conducted O
the O
business O
for O
himself. O
In O
February O
, O
1921 O
, O
Karnes O
leased O
or O
sublet O
the O
premises O
in O
question O
to O
one O
L. O
H. O
McHugh O
, O
a O
mechanic O
who O
moved O
into O
the O

and O
occupied O
it O
jointly O
with O
Karnes O
, O
McHugh O
paying O
Karnes O
the O
sum O
of O
$50 O

as O

. O
On O
the O
3rd O
day O
of O
May O
, O
1921 O
, O
Karnes O
had O
a O
notice O
prepared O
and O
sent O
to O
appellee O
, O
ostensibly O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
relieving O
himself O
from O
the O
obligations O
of O
the O
lease O
, O
notifying O
appellee O
that O
he O
would O
vacate O
the O
premises O
within O
a O
certain O
time O
unless O
the O
building O
was O
placed O
in O
a O
suitable O
state O
of O
repair. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
Karnes O
, O
through O
an O
attorney O
, O
caused O
to O
be O
prepared O
a O
letter O
to O
be O
sent O
to O
appellee O
by O
McHugh O
, O
who O
was O
then O
occupying O
the O
premises O
jointly O
with O
Karnes O
, O
and O
said O
letter O
was O
taken O
by O
Karnes O
to O
McHugh O
for O
his O
signature O
and O
was O
signed O
by O
McHugh. O
McHugh O
did O
not O
mail O
the O
letter O
to O
appellee O
but O
gave O
it O
to O
Karnes O
, O
who O
, O
it O
is O
fair O
to O
believe O
from O
this O
record O
, O
mailed O
the O
same O
to O
appellee. O
Appellee O
replied O
to O
the O
McHugh O
letter O
in O
which O
he O
informed O
McHugh O
that O
the O
building O
was O
leased O
and O
that O
the O
said O
lease O
had O
another O
year O
to O
run; O
that O
appellee O
would O
be O
glad O
to O
talk O
to O
McHugh O
in O
regard O
to O
leasing O
the O
building O
as O
soon O
as O
the O
other O
lease O
expired O
, O
which O
letter O
was O
received O
by O
McHugh O
. O
It O
appears O
from O
the O
record O
that O
after O
May O
, O
1921 O
, O
McHugh O
and O
another O
mechanic O
remained O
in O

$50 O

No O

, O
and O
this O

Appellants O
filed O
various O

the O

The O

alleges O
that O

the O

accepted O

, O
during O

the O
said O

made O

valuable O
improvements O

The O
cause O
was O

to O
the O

who O
found O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
appellee O
and O
a O
judgment O
was O
entered O
for O
the O
rent O
. O
Appellants O
allege O
error O
in O
the O
sustaining O
of O
the O
demurrer O
to O
the O
pleas O
of O
the O
appellants O
other O
than O
the O
third O
plea O
, O
but O
upon O
a O
careful O
reading O
of O
all O
of O
such O
pleas O
it O
is O
plain O
that O
all O
of O
said O
pleas O
state O
substantially O
the O

defense O
and O
appellants O
were O
not O
injured O
by O
the O
court O
sustaining O

pleas O

Appellants O
urge O
error O
bn O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
appellee O
made O
repairs O
upon O
said O
building O
, O
built O

a O

, O
effected O
an O
acceptance O
of O
the O
premises O
and O
a O
surrender O
on O
the O
part O
of O
appellee O
. O
We O
do O
not O
agree O
with O
appellants\u2019 O
contention. O
Appellee O
was O
not O
required O
under O
the O
lease O
to O
make O
such O
repairs O
nor O
to O
build O
a O
new O
roof. O
Appellants O
had O
requested O
the O
making O
of O
such O
repairs. O
Appellants O
cannot O
now O
take O
advantage O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
appellee O
made O
such O
repairs O
or O
even O
built O
a O
new O
roof O
at O
the O
request O
of O
appellants. O
There O
is O
no O

in O
this O

tending O

show O
that O
the O
appellee O
consented O
to O
the O
surrender O

the O

and O
containing O
the O
usual O
conditions O
of O
instruments O

that O
character O
in O
common O
use O
.in O
this O
State. O
It O
was O
dated O
November O
11 O
, O
1920 O
, O
and O
contained O
the O
covenant O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
grantee O
to O
complete O
a O
well O
on O
the O
premises O
within O
twelve O
months O
from O
that O
date O
or O
the O
grant O
should O
become O
null O
and O
void. O
The O
lease O
was O
assigned O
on O
April O
6 O
, O
1921 O
, O
to O
the O
Southern O
Illinois O
Gas O
Company. O
No O
well O
was O
completed O
on O
the O
premises O
within O
the O
year O
, O
and O
on O
November O
11 O
, O
1921 O
, O
the O
grantors O
served O
notice O
on O
the O
assignee O
of O
the O
lease O
of O
their O
election O
to O
declare O
a O
forfeiture O
of O
the O
lease O
and O
a O
demand O
for O
the O
possession O
of O
the O
premises. O
Thereupon O
the O
Southern O
Illinois O
Gas O
Company O
filed O
a O
bill O
against O
the O
lessors O
to O
enjoin O
them O
from O
interfering O
, O
by O
suit O
at O
law O
or O
otherwise O
, O
with O
the O
complainant\u2019s O
possession O
of O
the O
premises O
or O
the O
completion O
of O
a O
well O
on O
them. O
The O
bill O
was O
amended O
, O
a O
demurrer O
was O
sustained O
to O
the O
amended O
bill O
, O
it O
was O
dismissed O
for O
want O
of O
equity O
, O
and O
the O
complainant O
appealed O
. O
It O
is O
argued O
in O
behalf O
of O
the O
complainant O
that O
the O
time O
limit O
for O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
well O
was O
waived O
by O
the O
appellees O
, O
and O
that O
is O
the O
main O
point O
in O
the O
case. O
The O
bill O
contains O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
lease O
and O
also O
attempts O
to O
state O
some O
of O
its O
terms O
according O
to O
their O
legal O
effect. O
The O
latter O
statements O
are O
in O
some O
respects O
inconsistent O
with O
the O
words O
of O
the O
lease O
, O
and O
in O
these O
particulars O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
pleader O
must O
yield O
to O
the O
words O
of O
the O
instrument. O
In' O
some O
of O
its O
allegations O
the O
bill O
is O
vague O
and O
indefinite; O
and O
another O
rule O
to O
be O
borne O
in O
mind O
is O
that O
the O
allegations O
are O
to O
be O
taken O
most O
strongly O
against O
the O
pleader. O
After O
stating O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
lease O
the O
bill O
avers O
that O
it O

The O

April O

so O
that O
this O

No O

The O

No O
such O

No O
showing O

made O
that O
the O
appellant O
exercised O
any O
degree O
of O
dili*145gence O
either O
in O
the O

whether O
it O

continuously O
or O

and O
no O

It O
is O
stated O
that O
owing O

on O
account O
of O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
soil O

of O

the O
contractor O
was O
unable O
to O

the O
well O
in O
time O
though O
he O
had O
drilled O
to O
a O
depth O
of O
700 O

, O
and O
that O
it O

necessary O
that O

and O
the O
complainant O
is O
informed O
and O
believes O
that O
a O

can O
be O
completed O
within O
thirty O

The O
allegation O
that O
the O

had O
deposited O
$323.88 O
rent O
for O
the O
second O
year O
in O
the O
Harrisburg O
State O

Bank O
is O
of O
no O
importance O
, O
since O
the O

says O
nothing O
concerning O
such O
rent. O
The O
fact O
that O
two O
of O
the O
appellees O
were O
employed O
by O
the O
contractor O
in O
the O
drilling O
of O
the O
well O
could O
not O
estop O
the O
appellees O

a O
forfeiture O
because O
of O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
conditions O
of O
the O
lease O
within O
twelve O

The O
complainant O
was O
not O
misled O
or O
placed O
in O
any O
worse O
position O
by O
the O
fact O
of O
the O
appellees\u2019 O
employment O
by O
the O
contractor. O
The O
right O
of O
the O
appellees O
to O
declare O
the O
forfeiture O
of O
the O
lease O
for O
failure O
to O
complete O
the O
well O
within O
twelve O

was O
absolute O

a O

of O
equity O
could O
not O
enjoin O
its O
exercise O
unless O
facts O
were O

making O
such O
exercise O

The O

entirely O
failed O
to O
state O
any O
facts O
which O
would O
justify O
the O
interference O
of O
a O
court O
of O
equity. O
It O
stated O
conclusions O
of O
the O
pleader O
unsupported O
by O
any O

It O
stated O
the O

of O

The O

alleges O
that O

agent O
*240for O
the O
transfer O
, O
of O

by O

that O

appellant O

one O
of O
which O
was O
located O
in O
Rock O

, O
in O

that O
the O

, O
that O
the O

in O
these O

more O

$500 O

deeded O

sam\u00e9 O
to O

that O

found O
that O

were O
worth O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
$4000 O
over O
the O
incumbrances O
thereon; O
that O
the O

the O
part O
of O
appellee O
to O
pay O
a O

commission O
to O
appellant O
for O
the O
services O
rendered.; O
that O
, O
since O
the O
transaction O
he O
has O
been O
informed O
and O
believes O
that O
appellant O
was O
also O
acting O
as O
agent O
for O
Gettle. O
The O
bill O
asks O
an O
accounting O
to O
determine O
what O
, O
if O
any O
, O
fees O
and O
commission O
are O
due O
to O
the O
appellant. O
Appellant O
answered O
, O
denying O
any O
false O
or O
fraudulent O
representations O
as O
to O
the O
value O
of O
the O
pieces O
of O
property O
deeded O
to O
him O
as O
his O
commission O
and O
averring O
that O
the O
conveyance O
to O
him O
was O
freely O
and O
voluntarily O
made O
and O
agreed O
upon O
, O
and O
that O
the O
property O
deeded O
is O
not O
worth O
$4000 O
above O
the O
incumbrances O
but O
that O
the O
actual O
value O
thereof O
did O
not O
exceed O
$500. O
The O
chancellor O
found O
that O
the O
properties O
in O
question O
were O
worth O
substantially O
more O
than O
$500 O
over O
and O
above O
the O
incumbrances O
thereon; O
also O
that O
the O
appellant O
was O
acting O
as O
the O
agent O
for O
both O
appellee O
and O
Gettle O
with O
the O
knowledge O
and O
consent O
of O
both O
of O
them; O
that O
appellant O
did O
not O
inform O
appellee O
concerning O
the O
value O
of O
the O
properties O
deeded O
to O
him O
as O
a O
commission O
, O
as O
was O
required O
of O
him O
as O
agent O
, O
and O
that O
appellee O
relied O
upon O
appellant\u2019s O
representations O
in O
that O
matter. O
The O
chancellor O
decreed O
that O
the O
deeds O
be' O
set O
aside O
as-*241clouds O
upon O
the O
title O
of O
appellee O
, O
and O
that O
because O
of O
misrepresentations O
and O
bad O
faith O
appellant O
was O
not O
entitled O
to O
any O
commission O
for O
his O
services O
. O
An O
examination O
of O
the O
record O
discloses O
that O
the O
chancellor\u2019s O
finding O
as O
to O
the O
value O
of O
the O
two O
pieces O
of O
property O
in O
question O
is O
amply O
sustained O
by O
the O
evidence; O
also O
that O
appellant O
was O
acting O
as O
the O
agent O
of O
both O
parties O
in O
this O
transaction O
with O
the O
knowledge O
and O
consent O
of O
both. O
The O
evidence O
also O
discloses O
that O
appellee O
relied O
upon O
the O
statement O
of O
appellant O
as O
to O
the O
value O
of O
the O
two O
pieces O
of O
property O
deeded O
to O
him O
as O
his O
commission O
. O
Appellant O
contends O
that O
it O
was O
the O
duty O
of O
appellee O
to O
use O
diligence O
in O
knowing O
what O
the O
properties O
were O
worth. O
As O
between O
appellee O
and O
Gettle O
, O
the O
other O
party O
to O
the O
trade O
by O
which O
the O
property O
was O
acquired O
, O
this O
would O
be O
true O
, O
but O
as O
to O
appellant O
, O
who O
was O
acting O
as O
the O
agent O
of O
appellee O
as O
well O
as O
Gettle O
, O
such O
a O
rule O
has O
no O
application O
, O
as O
the O
agent O
of O
appellee O
was O
bound O
to O
use O
good O
faith O
in O
giving O
to O
his O
principal O
correct O
information O
concerning O
the O
character O
and O
value O
of O
the O
property. O
This O
the O
record O
shows O
he O
did O
not O
do O
, O
and O
the O
decree O
that O
the O
deeds O
to O
him O
be O
set O
aside O
is O
right O
. O
The O
chancellor O
, O
however O
, O
was O
not O
justified O
, O
under O
the O
issues O
made O
up O
in O
the O
bill O
, O
in O
denying O
appellant O
a O
reasonable O
commission O
for O
his O
services O
as O
appellee\u2019s O
agent. O
Appellee O
by O
his O
bill O
asks O
for O
an O
accounting O
and O
offers O
to O
pay O
a O
reasonable O
commission O
, O
stating O
that O
the O
value O
of O
the O
property O
transferred O
by O
him O
was O
$20 O
, O
000 O
and O
that O
a O
reasonable O
fate O
to O
be O
paid O
as O
a O
commission O
would O
be O
two O
and O
a O
half O
per O
cent O
, O
amounting O
to O
$500 O
, O
thus O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
stating O
in O
his O
bill O
that O
he O
considers O
$500 O
to O
be O
a O
reasonable O
commission. O
There O
is O
no O
denial O
of O
this O
averment. O
Appellee O
testified O
that O
appellant O
was O
acting O
as O
agent O
for O
both O
of O
the O
parties O
to O
the O
trade. O
The O
rule O
is O
that O
one O
may O
act O
as O
agent O
for O
both O
parties O
to O
a O
transaction O
if O
it O
be.with O
their O
full O
knowledge O
and O
consent. O
(Adams O
v. O

\u2022While O
the O
evidence O
does O
not O
show O
that O
either O
appellant O
or O
*242Gettle O
knew O
what O
commission O
the O
other O
was O
to O
pay O
, O
it O
is O
only O
reasonable O
to O
say O
that O
they O
expected O
that O
he O
would O
receive O
a O
commission O
from O
each. O
However O
that O
may O
be O
, O
in O
the O
bill O
presented O
here O
appellee O
offers O
to O
pay O
a O
reasonable O
commission O
, O
which O
he O
intimates O
is O
$500. O
It O
is O
a O
fundamental O
principle O
of O
equity O
that O
he O
who O
seeks O
equity O
must O
do O
equity O
, O
and O
where O
by O
his O
bill O
he O
makes O
offer O
to O
pay O
a O
reasonable O
sum O
the O
court O
is O
not O
justified O
in O
giving O
him O
more O
than O
he O
asks. O
We O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
the O
court O
should O
have O
decreed O
that O
the O
deeds O
be O
set O

payment O
by O

to O

of O
the O
sum O
of O

within O
a O
time O

Mr. B-A
Justice I-A
Carter I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
Isaac O
Jones O
, O
was O
indicted O
by O
the O
grand O
jury O
in O
Macon O
county O
for O
burglary. O
When O
Jones O
was O
arraigned O
, O
being O
represented O
by O
counsel O
, O
he O
waived O
a O
jury O
and O
pleaded O
guilty O
and O
was O
thereupon O
sentenced O
to O
the O
St. O
Charles O
School O
for O
Boys. O
Later O
this O
judgment O
was O
set O
aside O
and O
he O
was O
sentenced O
by O
the O
circuit O
court O
to O
confinement O
in O
the O
State O
reformatory O
at O
Pontiac. O
The O
cause O
has O
been O
brought O
to O
this O
court O
by O
writ O
of O
error O
, O
reversible O
error O
on O
the O
record O
being O
alleged O
. O
*126It O
is O
contended O
that O
error O
was O
committed O
in O
that O
the O
plea O
of O
guilty O
was O
not O
properly O
explained O
to O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
by O
the O
trial O
judge O
, O
as O
required O
by O
law. O
It O
appears O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error\u2019s O
grandmother O
swore O
to O
an O
affidavit O
, O
which O
was O
originally O
in O
the O
record O
filed O
in O
this O
court O
, O
denying O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
had O
been O
properly O
admonished O
by O
the O
trial O
court O
as O
to O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
plea O
of O
guilty. O
This O
affidavit O
was O
stricken O
from O
the O
record O
by O
this O
court O
on O
motion. O
Both O
the O
abstract O
and O
the O
record O
show O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
was O
admonished O
by O
the O
court O
as O
to O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
plea O
of O
guilty O
and O
that O
he O
still O
persisted O
in O
such O
plea. O
On O
this O
record O
it O
must O
be O
held O
, O
under O
the O
former O
decisions O
of O
this O
court O
, O
" O
that O
compliance O
was O
had O
with O
the O
requirement O
of O
the O
statute O
that O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
plea O
of O
guilty O
should O
be O
explained O
to O
the O
accused. O

, O
and O
cases O
cited.) O
Under O
these O
authorities O
the O
record O
is O
not O
faulty O
on O
said O
question O
raised O
by O
counsel O
for O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
. O
It O
is O
also O
urged O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
committed O
error O
in O
setting O
aside O
the O
judgment O
against O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
which O
sentenced O
him O
to O
the O
St. O
Charles O
School O
for O
Boys O
and O
afterwards O
sentencing O
him O
to O
the O
State O
reformatory O
at O
Pontiac. O
The O
record O
shows O
that O
Jones O
was O
past O
sixteen O
years O
of O
age O
at O
the O
time O
he O
committed O
the O
offense O
and O
that O
he O
was O
sentenced O
on O
November O
18 O
, O
at O
the O
October O
term O
, O
1922 O
, O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Macon O
county. O
The O
record O
also O
shows O
that O
on O
November O
25 O
following O
, O
during O
the O
same O
October O
term O
of O
court O
, O
the O
sentence O
committing O
him. O
to O
St. O
Charles O
was O
set O
aside O
and O
the O
court O
committed O
him O
to O
the O
State O
reformatory. O
The O
record O
does O
not O
show O
why O
this O
change O
was O
made O
, O
but O
we O
assume O
from O
what O
is O
said O
in O
the O
briefs O
that O
the O
court O
found O
that O
under O
the O
statute O
a O
person O
could O
not O
be O
sentenced O
to O
the O
St. O
Charles O
school O
if O
over O
sixteen O
years O
of O
age O
, O
but O
should O
be O
sentenced O
on O
the O
record O
, O
when O
the O
crime O
was O
committed O
after O
reaching O
such O
age O
, O
to O
the O
State O
reformatory O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
fact O
was O
*127ascertained O
that O
a O
mistake O
was O
made O
in O
sentencing O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
to O
the O
St. O

school O
, O
after O
the O
sentence O
was O
entered O

the O
same O
term O
, O
on O
motion O
of O
the O
State\u2019s O

of O
Macon O

the O
court O
set O
aside O
the O
order O
committing O
to O
the O

entered O
another O
order O

plaintiff O

Counsel O
for O

appear O
to O
rely O
in O
their O
argument O
on O
the O
point O
that O
the O
court O
improperly O
set O
aside O
the O
order O
committing O
plaintiff O

A O
reading O
of O
the O
opinion O
in O
the O
first O
case O
would O
seem O
to O
authorize O
the O
trial O

to O
change O
the O
order O
of O
commitment O
, O
as O
was O
done O
here O
, O
when O
it O
was O
found O
that O
a O
mistake O
had O
been O
made O
in O
committing O
to O
the O
wrong O
institution O
, O
and O
we O
see O
nothing O
in O
the O
reasoning O
of O
People O
v. O
Kielcsewski O
that O
would O
in O
any O
way O
conflict O
with O
the O
conclusion O
herein O
reached O
on O
this O
point O
. O
It O
is O
manifest O
from O
the O
record O
and O

that O
the O
age O
of O
the O
plaintiff O

with O
the O

at O

time O

at O
Terre O

, O

, O
to O
drive O
them O
to O

, O
that O
evening. O
About O
5 O
:3o O
in O
the O
afternoon O
of O
that O
day O
the O
taxi O
driver O
drove O
to O
the O
barber O
shop O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
in O
Terre O
Haute O
and O
there O
met O
Belle O
, O
Armstrong O
, O
Cummins O
and O
Wallace. O
Fortune O
was O
informed O
by O
the O
four O
men O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
drive O
to O
Robinson O
to O
engage O
in O
a O
big O
liquor O
deal. O
They O
left O
Terre O
Haute O
about O
six O
o\u2019clock O
in O
the O
evening. O
Fortune O
drove O
the O
automobile O
and O
Armstrong O
sat O
in O
the O
front O
seat O
with O
him O
, O
and O
Cummins O
and O
Belle O
occupied O
the O
rear O
seat. O
Either O
before O
or O
shortly O
after O
they O
left O
Terre O
Haute O
they O
changed O
their O
plans O
and O
directed O
Fortune O
to O
drive O
them O
to O
Paris O
, O
in O
Edgar O
county O
, O
Illinois. O
It O
appears O
from O
the O
evidence O
that O
Fortune O
understood O
that O
they O
were O
going O
to O
Paris O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
obtaining O
intoxicating O
liquor. O
Cummins O
testified O
that O
they O
went O
to O
Paris O
to O
rob O
a O
woman O
of O
her O
diamonds O
but O
that O
when O
they O
arrived O
in O
Paris O
he O
could O
not O
find O
the O
man O
he O
was O
to O
meet O
there O
to O
help O
commit O
the O
robbery. O
They O
arrived O
in O
Paris O
about O
8:3o O
P. O
M.' O
After O
a O
time O
they O
drove O
south O
from O
the O
public O
square O
to O
Crawford O
street O
and O
east O
to O
Marshall O
street O
, O
and O
when O
the O
car O
reached O
a O
dark O
place O
on O
that O
street O
, O
about O
100 O
yards O
south O
of O
the O
store O
burglarized O
and O
owned O
by O
Board O
, O
Cummins O
directed O
*595Fortune O
to O
stop O
his O
car O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
street. O
Cummins O
and O
Belle O
then O
left O
Fortune O
and O
Armstrong O
in O
the O
car O
and O
proceeded O
to O
the O
store O
in O
question O
, O
after O
Cummins O
had O
directed O
Fortune O
to O
keep O
his O
engine O
running O
until O
they O
returned. O
Cummins O
testified O
for O
the O
State O
that O
he O
and O
Belle O
left O
the O
car O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
robbing O
or O
burglarizing O
Board\u2019s O
store; O
that O
he O
told O
Belle O
to O
go O
in O
the O
store O
and O
purchase O
some O
groceries O
and O
see O
how O
it O
looked; O
that O
Belle O
went O
into O
the O
store O
and O
afterwards O
came O
out O
and O
said O
that O
things O
were O
looking O
all O
right O
and O
that O
he O
would O
go O
back O
into O
the O
store O
and O
call O
for O
soap; O
that O
he O
(Cummins) O
stood O
on O
the O
outside O
and O
looked O
in O
the O
window O
while O
Belle O
went O
in O
the O
first O
time; O
that O
he O
followed O
Belle O
in O
the O
store O
the O
second O
time O
, O
and O
after O
he O
had O
taken O
a O
step O
or O
two O
inside O
the O
store O
he O
ordered O
everyone O
to O
hold O
up O
their O
hands; O
that O
according O
to O
a O
pre-arranged O
plan O
between O
Belle O
and O
himself O
Belle O
held O
up O
his O
hands O
as O
did O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
people O
in O
the O
store; O
that O
he O
(Cummins) O
had O
a O
revolver O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
pointed O
it O
at O
the O
proprietor O
, O
who O
had O
his O
hands O
on O
the O
show O
case O
, O
and O
that O
when O
he O
demanded O
, O
\u201cHands O
up!\u201d O
Board O
first O
put O
his O
hands O
down O
and O
that O
he O
fired O
at O
him; O
that O
he O
then O
ordered O
Belle O
three O
times O
to O
go O
to O
the O
till O
and O
get O
the O
money O
but O
Belle O
did O
not O
do O
so; O
that O
while O
the O
witness O
was O
taking O
the O
money O
out O
of O
the O
till O
and O
searching O
Board\u2019s O
person O
Belle O
\u201cgot O
cold O
feet\u201d O
and O
ran O
out O
of O
the O
store O
and O
to O
the O
car; O
that O
he O
followed O
Belle O
shortly O
after O
, O
and O
both O
got O
into O
the O
car O
and O
ordered O
Fortune O
to O
drive O
them O
rapidly O
out O
of O
the O
city O
. O
Belle O
in O
his O
testimony O
admitted O
that O
he O
took O
part O
in O
the O
burglary O
of O
the O
store O
in O
the O
manner O
testified O
to O
by O
Cummins O
, O
but O
his O
testimony O
was O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
after O
they O
left O
the O
car O
for O
the O
store O
Cummins O
said O
to O
him O
, O
\u201cDamn O
you O
, O
go O
in O
the O
store O
and O
buy O
groceries; O
it O
ain\u2019t O
whisky O
we\u2019re O
after.\u201d O
The O
remainder O
of O
his O
testimony O
is O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
Cummins O
compelled O
him O
with O
his O
revolver O
to O
go O
into O
the O
store O
and O
buy O
groceries O
and O
take O
part O
in O
the O
burglary O
, O
and O
all O
that O
he O
did O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
burglary O
he O
did O
while O
*596under O
duress O
and O
while O
threatened O
by O
Cummins O
with O
a O
revolver. O
When O
he O
ran O
back O
to O
the O
car O
he O
said O
to O
Armstrong O
and O
Fortune O
as O
he O
jumped O
into O
the O
car O
, O
\u201cLet\u2019s O
get O
out O
of O
here; O
Cummins O
has O
held O
up O
that O
store; O
step O
on O
her.\u201d O
Cummins O
followed O
Belle O
so O
closely O
out O
of O
the O
store O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
jump O
on O
the O
car O
and O
get O
into O
it O
before O
it O
got O
into O
rapid O
motion O
and O
said O
to O
Belle O
, O
\u201cYou O
done O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
trick O
when O
you O
seen O
what O
I O
was O
doing; O
if O
I O
would O
do O
right O
I O
would O
slap O
you O
in O
the O
mouth.\u201d O
This O
is O
the O
only O
corroboration O
of O
Belle\u2019s O
claim O
that O
during O
the O
burglary O
he O
acted O
under O
duress O
, O
and O
the O
things O
that O
both O
Belle O
and O
Cummins O
said O
as O
they O
got O
into O
the O
car O
are O
equally O
corroborative O
of-the O
testimony O
of O
Cummins O
, O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
Belle O
voluntarily O
took O
part O
in O
the O
burglary O
and O
got O
scared O
and O
ran O
away O
after O
Cummins O
fired O
the O
shot O
at O
Board. O
. O
Belle O
was O
the O
first O
of O
the O
defendants O
to O
be O
arrested O
, O
about O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
after O
the O
burglary O
occurred. O
He O
made O
a O
confession O
to O
the O
sheriff O
after O
his O
arrest O
and O
told O
the O
story O
in O
detail O
of O
how O
the O
burglary O
was O
planned O
and O
executed O
and O
said O
that O
he O
would O
not O
have O
committed O
the O
burglary O
if O
he O
had O
not O
been O
drunk. O
He O
never O
at O
any O
time O
before O
he O
was O
arrested O
told O
anybody O
anything O
about O
the O
crime O
he O
had O
assisted O
in O
committing. O
He O
never O
made O
the O
claim O
that O
he O
. O
committed O
the O
burglary O
under O
duress O
until O
he O
got O
on O
the O
witness O
stand O
to O
testify. O
Cummins\u2019 O
statement O
that O
Belle O
told O
him O
after O
he O
had O
purchased O
all O
the O
groceries O
except O
some O
soap O
that O
he O
would O
go O
back O
and O
call O
for O
soap O
is O
corroborated O
by O
the O
testimony O
of O
Board O
and O
a O
witness O
named O
Hamilton O
, O
both O
of O
whom O
testified O
that O
just O
before O
Belle O
went O
out O
of O
the O
store O
he O
said O
to O
Board O
that O
he O
wanted O
some O
soap O
but O
did O
not O
know O
the O
kind O
he O
wanted O
and O
would O
go O
out O
and O
see O
his O
wife O
and O
find O
out. O
He O
had O
no O
wife O
there O
to O
interview O
, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
occasion O
for O
his O
making O
up O
this O
story O
if O
he O
was O
acting O
under O
duress O
, O
as O
Cummins O
was O
out- O
- O
side O
and O
not O
in O
hearing O
of O
this O
conversation. O
The O
evidence O
*597of O
Belle\u2019s O
guilt O
is O
very O
convincing O
, O
and O
the O
jury O
could O
not O
r O
easonably O
have O
returned O
any O
verdict O
except O
that O
of O
his O
guilt O
. O
The O
points O
of O
law O
raised O
by O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
are O
, O
(1) O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
refusing O
to O
give O
an O
instruction O
offered O
by O
him O
defining O
the O
term O
\u201creasonable O
doubt;\u201d O
(2) O
that O
the O
conviction O
was O
based O
solely O
upon O
the O
testimony O
of O
an O
accomplice O
, O
Cummins O
, O
who O
was O
not O
corroborated O
by O
other O
evidence; O
(3) O
that O
there O
was O
a O
variance O
in O
the O
allegation O
and O
proof O
as O
to O
the O
ownership O
of O
the O
store O
, O
the O
allegation O
being O
that O
the O
store O
was O
the O
property O
of O
S. O
Arthur O
Board O
and O
the O
proof O
showed O
that O
it O
was O
the O
property O
of O
S. O
A. O
Board; O
and O
(4) O
that O
the O
corpus O
delicti O
could O
not O
be O
established O
solely O
by O
his O
confession O
. O
This O
court O
has O
held O
that O
it O
is O
doubtful O
whether O
any O
better O
definition O
of O
the O
term O
\u201creasonable O
doubt\u201d O
can O
be O
found O
than O
the O
words O
themselves O
, O
and O
that O
that O
term O
has O
no O
other O
and O
different O
meaning O
in O
law O
than O
it O
has O
when O
used O
in O
ordinary O
transactions O
or O
affairs O
of O
life. O
(People O

Barkas O
, O

This O
court O
has O
many O
times O
intimated O
that O
the O
giving O
of O
many O
instructions O
on O
reasonable O
doubt O
might O
result O
in O
so O
much O
confusion O
as O
to O
cause O
the O
reversal O
of O
a O
judgment O
of O
conviction. O
While O
we O
have O
approved O
the O
giving O
of O
an O
instruction O
that O
defines O
correctly O
and O
concisely O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
term O
\u201creasonable O
doubt O
, O
\u201d O
we O
are O
not O
disposed O
to O
reverse O
a O
judgment O
of O
conviction O
in O
a O
case O
for O
the O
reason O
, O
alone O
, O
that O
no O
instruction O
was O
given O
defining O
that O
term O
, O
and O
particularly O
where O
it O
does O
not O
appear O
that O
the O
defendant O
was O
prejudiced O
by O
such O
refusal. O
The O
defendant O
was O
not O
so O
prejudiced O
in O
this O
case O
, O
and O
the O
court O
did O
not O
err O
in O
refusing O
to O
give O
the O
instruction O
. O
Plaintiff O
in O
error\u2019s O
second O
and O
fourth O
propositions O
have O
no O
standing O
in O
this O
case. O
His O
conviction O
was O
not O
based O
solely O
on O
the O
testimony O
of O
an O
accomplice O
, O
as O
has O
already O
been O
shown O
, O
and O
the O
corpus O

was O
established O
by O
three O
witnesses O
, O
Cummins O
, O

and O

as O

the O

to O
Bynum O
and O
Mrs. O

were O
not O

made O
with O
the O
intention O
*24of O
defrauding O

other O

that O
they O

benefit O
and O
to O

if O
it O
was O
obtained O
it O
was O
by O
forgery O
, O
perjury O
, O
fraud O
, O
deceit O
and O
viciousness. O
They O
did O
admit O
that O
the O
real O
estate O
in O
question O
was O
owned O
by O
Hayes O
and O
that O
the O
transfers O
by O
him O
to O
Bynum O
and O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
were O
made O
but O
denied O
all O
charge O
of O
fraud O
in O
connection O
therewith O
, O
and O
alleged O
that O
the O
transfers O
were O
bona O

, O
of O
the O
character O
they O
purported O
to O
be O
and O
for O
the O

The O
facts O
concerning O
the O
obtaining O
of O
the O
judgment O
by O
appellee O
, O
of O
the O
ownership O
of O
the O
property O
by O
Edwin O
H. O
Hayes O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
executed O
the O
trust O
deed O
and O
notes O
to O
Bynum O
, O
and O
the O
quit-claim O
deed O
to O
Sarah O
Miniter O
for O
an O
alleged O
consideration O
of O
$1500 O
, O
that O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
judgment O
was O
returned O
wholly O
unsatisfied O
, O
and O
that O
Hayes O
had O
no O
other O
property O
out O
of O
which O
the O
judgment O
can O
be O
made O
, O
were O
fully O
proved O
and O
are O
undisputed. O
The O
following O
facts O
are O
also O
established O
by O
the O
proofs O
in O
the O
record: O
Appellee O
was O
the O
second O
wife O
of O
Hayes O
, O
who O
was O
a O
practicing O
physician O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Chicago. O
Their O
relations O
as O
husband O
and O
wife O
were O
interrupted O
by O
misunderstandings O
between O
each O
other O
which O
resulted O
in O
separation O
and O
litigation. O
About O
January O
, O
1911 O
, O
she O
began O
a O
suit O
in O
the O
circuit O
*26court O
of O
Cook O
county O
for O
separate O
maintenance O
, O
which O
appears O
to O
have O
been O
very O
bitterly O
contested O
but O
with O
what O
result O
does O
not O
appear. O
Bynum O
was O
attorney O
for O
Hayes O
in O
that O
litigation O
, O
and O
the O
trust O
deed O
and O
mortgage O
executed O
to O
him O
by O
the O
doctor O
were O
in O
consideration O
of O
the O
services O
rendered O
him O
by O
Bynum O
in O
that O
suit O
and O
for O
cash O
money O
furnished O
him O
at O
different O
times O
pending O
that O
litigation. O
It O
appears O
that O
after O
that O
litigation O
, O
about O
August O
28 O
, O
1912 O
, O
appellee O
and O
Hayes O
began O
living O
together O
again O
, O
and O
that O
after O
that O
time O
they O
again O
separated O
, O
she O
going O
to O
what O
she O
called O
her O
home O
in O
Middleville O
, O
New O
York. O
In O
the O
fall O
of O
1918 O
he O
secured O
a O
divorce O
from O
her O
while O
she O
was O
residing O
in O
New O
York O
, O
as O
she O
learned O
on O
her O
return O
to O
Chicago O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1919. O
She O
had O
previously O
obtained O
her O
judgment O
and O
on O
October O
10 O
, O
1919 O
, O
filed O
her O
present O
bill. O
The O
note O
upon O
which O
she O
recovered O
judgment O
was O
given O
to O
her O
by O
Hayes O
for O
money O
she O
had O
loaned O
him O
to O
remove O
an O
incumbrance O
upon O
the O
property O
, O
which O
is O
also O
the O
subject O
of O
this O
litigation. O
After O
they O
began O
living O
together O
in O
1912 O
Hayes O
frequently O
had O
conversations O
with O
her O
about O
the O
note O
given O
to O
her O
by O
him O
, O
in O
all O
of O
which O
conversations O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
tear O
up O
the O
note O
, O
which O
she O
refused O
to O
do. O
At O
various O
times O
on O
such O
refusals O
he O
told O
her O
that O
he O
would O
never O
pay O
the O
note O
, O
and O
in O
one O
or O
more O
of O
these O
conversations O
he O
also O
told O
her O
that O
he O
would O
never O
pay O
a O
dollar O
on O
the O
note O
and O
that O
he O
would O
fix O
his O
property O
so O
that O
she O
could O
not O
collect O
it. O
None O
of O
these O
conversations O
concerning O
the O
note O
and O
the O
payment O
of O
it O
are O
disputed. O
In O
1914 O
, O
while O
she O
and O
Hayes O
were O
living O
in O
the O
property O
in O
question O
, O
he O
was O
getting O
$22 O
per O
month O
each O
for O
the O
first O
and O
second O
flats O
and O
$20 O
for O
the O
third O
, O
or O
$768 O
per O
annum. O
The O
value O
of O
the O
property O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
trial O
was O
$6000 O
or O
$6500. O
The O
quit-claim O
deed O
to O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
was O
executed O
by O
Hayes O
pending O
the O
suit O
by O
appellee O
against O
him O
for O
judgment O
on O
his O
note O
and O
about O
two O
months O
before O
that O

was O
obtained. O
The O

was O
executed O
on O
September O

$1450 O

She O
also O

that O

that O

. O
The O
proofs O
in O
the O
case O
established O
without O
dispute O
that O
the O
quit-claim O
deed O
to O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
was O
made O
by O
Hayes O
with O
the O
actual O
intent O
to O
hinder O
, O
delay O
and O
defraud O
appellee O
and O
to O
prevent O
her O
from O
realizing O
the O
amount O
of O
her O
indebtedness O
against O
him O
out O
of O
the O
property O
in O
question. O
They O
also O
establish O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
quit-claim O
deed O
was O
executed O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
securing O
a O
loan O
of O
$1500 O
to O
him O
by O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
, O
and O
that O
this O
deed O
, O
though O
absolute O
in O
form O
, O
was O
only O
a O
mortgage O
, O
and O
it O
must O
therefore O
be O
held O
fraudulent O
as O
to O
appellee. O
The O
rule O
is O
established O
in O
this O
*28State O
that O
a O
conveyance O
of O
property O
which O
is O
absolute O
upon O
its O
face O
but O
which O
is O
really O
intended O
as O
a O
mortgage O
or O
security O
is O
binding O
as O
between O
the O
parties O
but O
is O
fraudulent O
as O
to O
creditors O
, O
even O
though O
the O
grantee O
or O
mortgagee O
did O
not O
actually O
participate O
in O
the O
intent O
of O
the O
grantor O
or O
mortgagor O
to O
defraud O
his O
creditors. O
In O
other O
words O
, O
Mrs. O
Miniter\u2019s O
act O
in O
accepting O
such O
instrument O
was O
constructively O
fraudulent O
or O
a O
fraud O
in O
law. O
(Beidler O
v. O
Crane O
, O
135 O
Ill. O
92; O
Clark O
v. O
Harper O
, O
215 O
id. O
24.) O
It O
is O
also O
the O
rule O
in O
equity O
that O
where O
a O
conveyance O
or O
transfer O
of O
property O
is O
set O
aside O
solely O
upon O
the O
ground O
that O
it O
is O
constructively O
fraudulent O
as O
to O
creditors O
it O
will O
still O
be O
upheld O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
actual O
consideration O
and O
be O
vacated O
only O
as O
to O
the O
excess. O
(Beidler O
v. O
Crane O
, O
supra.) O
The O
fact O
is O
that O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
defended O
in O
this O
case O
and" O
made O
the O
actual O
claim O
that O
the O
quit-claim O
deed O
to O
her O
was O
as O
it O
purported O
to O
be O
, O
\u2014 O
an O
absolute O
deed O
, O
\u2014 O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
understanding O
between O
her O
and O
Hayes O
that O
the O
same O
was O
to O
be O
only O
security O
for O
the O
$1500 O
obtained O
from O
her O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
no O
understanding O
between O
them O
that O
he O
was O
to O
have O
any O
further O
interest O
in O
the O
property. O
As O
held O
in O
both O
of O
the O
cases O
above O
cited O
, O
this O
act O
on O
her O
part O
is O
strong O
evidence O
of O
actual O
fraud O
, O
and O
the O
court\u2019s O
action'in O
decreeing O
that O
the O
deed O
to O
her O
should O
be O
set O
aside O
only O
as O
to O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
premises O
after O
her O
claim O
was O
satisfied O
is O
certainly O
as O
much O
consideration O
as O
she O
was O
entitled O
to O
. O
It O
is O
insisted O
by O
appellant O
that O
the O
evidence O
does O
not O
warrant O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
court O
that O
the O
deed O
to O
her O
was O
simply O
made O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
securing O
the O
$1500 O
paid O
by O
her O
to O
Hayes. O
We O
think O
the O
evidence O
warranted O
the O
court O
in O
making O
that O
finding O
notwithstanding O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
testified O
and O
gave O
a O
different O
version O
of O
her O
conversation O
with O
Shanesy O
over O
the O
telephone. O
She O
admits O
having O
the O
conversation O
over O
the O
telephone O
with O
him O
, O
but O
testified O
that O
he O
asked O
her O
if O
she O
had O
bought O
the O
property O
in O
question O
, O
and O
that O
she O
replied O
that O
she O
had; O
that O
he O
then O
asked O
her O
*29if O
she O
paid O
for O
it O
with O
money O
or O
notes O
, O
and O
she O
replied O
that O
she O
paid O
for O
it O
with O
money; O
that O
he O
then O
said O
that O
it O
would O
not O
be O
necessary O
for O
him O
to O
see O
her O
as O
he O
could O
do O
no O
good O
for O
Mrs. O
Hayes O
under O
any O
circumstances. O
The O
important O
fact O
that O
Shanesy O
was O
wanting O
to O
know O
, O
according O
to O
his O
testimony O
, O
was O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
deed O
was O
an O
absolute O
deed O
or O
simply O
made O
to O
secure O
a O
loan O
, O
and O
he O
testified O
that O
at O
that O
time O
he O
put O
in O
writing O
the O
words O
that O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
said O
to O
him O
over O
the O
phone O
and O
preserved O
the O
writing. O
He O
was O
not O
appellee\u2019s O
attorney O
in O
this O
litigation. O
He O
was O
corroborated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
Hayes O
after O
that O
time O
was O
keeping O
a O
sign O
on O
the O
premises O
notifying O
the O
public O
that O
there O
were O
apartments O
there O
to O
rent O
and O
asking O
them O
to O
call O
at O
his O
residence O
concerning O
the O
same. O
The O
fact O
that O
he O
did O
that O
is O
denied O
by O
no O
one O
and O
no O
explanation O
is O
given O
of O
it O
, O
and O
we O
do O
not O
think O
that O
under O
the O
evidence O
we O
would O
be O
warranted O
in O
overruling O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
court O
in O
the O
particular O
mentioned O
. O
It O
is O
also O
contended O
by O
appellant O
that O
the O
decree O
was O
not O
warranted O
by O
the O
allegations O
made O
in O
the O
bill O
and O
the O
prayer O
for O
relief. O
The O
whole O
substance O
of O
the O
bill O
in O
that O
regard O
has O
already O
been O
stated O
, O
and O
it O
was O
amply O
sufficient O
to O
authorize O
a O
decree O
against O
the O
appellant. O
The O
decree O
, O
however O
, O
is O
in O
some O
particulars O
inaccurate O
and O
erroneous O
, O
as O
suggested O
by O
appellant. O
Under O
the O
showing O
in O
the O
record O
appellee O
has O
no O
inchoate O
right O
of O
dower O
, O
as O
she O
was O
divorced O
at O
the O
suit O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
which O
necessarily O
implies O
that O
the O
same O
was O
obtained O
for O
her O
fault O
and O
her O
prospective O
right O
of O
dower O
was O
forever O
extinguished. O
The O
decree O
should O
therefore O
find O
that O
such O
inchoate O
right O
of O
dower O
had O
been O
extinguished O
, O
without O
directing O
her O
to O
release O
such O
supposed O
right O
after O
sale O
to O
the O
purchaser. O
The O
decree O
ought O
also O
to O
provide O
that O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
may O
pay O
the O
amount O
of O
appellee\u2019s O
lien O
and O
costs O
of O
suit O
if O
she O
so O
desires O
, O
and O
that O
on O
doing O
so O
the O
decree O
in O
favor O
of O
appellee O
shall O
be O
satisfied O
and O
the O
title O
to O
the O
premises O
vest O
in O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
, O
subject O
*30only O
to O
the O
lien O
of O
Bynum. O
The O
decree O
should O
also O
direct O
that O
any O
surplus O
after O
the O
satisfaction O
of O
appellee\u2019s O
lien O
, O
in O
case O
of O
sale O
, O
shall O
be O
paid O
to O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
and O
not O
to O
Hayes. O
Hayes O
was O
properly O
found O
guilty O
of O
actual O
fraud O
and O
is O
entitled O
to O
nothing O
by O
reason O
thereof O
, O
and O
for O
the O
further O
reason O
that O
he O
attended O
the O
trial O
and O
permitted O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
, O
without O
protest O
or O
objection O
, O
to O
defend O
this O
suit O
under O
claim O
that O
the O
quit-claim O
deed O
was O
an O
absolute O
conveyance O
to O
her O
and O
not O
by O
way O
of O
security O
for O
the O
loan O
. O
The O
record O
shows O
that O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
collected O
more O
than O
$400 O
per O
year O
rents O
over O
and O
above O
the O
amount O
that O
she O
paid O
for O
interest O
to O
Bynum O
and O
taxes O
and O
probable O
insurance O
, O
- O
and O
considering O
these O
facts O
the O
court O
dealt O
with O
her O
very O
liberally O
and O
generously O
in O
its O
decree. O
As O
the O
decree O
will O
have O
to O
be O
reversed O
and O
the O
cause O
remanded O
for O
errors O
therein O
, O
we O
think O
that O
any O
rents O
that O
Mrs. O
Miniter O
has O
collected O
since O
the O
date O
of O
the O
decree O
, O
February O
16 O
, O
1922 O
, O
should O
be O
applied O
as O
credits O
on O
her O
lien O
of O
$1500 O
after O
deducting O
from O
such O
rents O
whatever O
necessary O
expenses O
she O
may O
have O
incurred O
since O
that O
date O
in O
the O
payment O
of O
interest O
to O
Bynum O
, O
taxes O
, O
insurance O
and O
other O
such O
matters O
, O
and O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
her O
lien O
should O
be O
specified O
in O
the O
decree O
as O
the O
net O
balance O
. O
The O
decree O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
is O
therefore O
reversed O
and. O
the O
cause O
remanded O
, O

by O

The O
facts O
proved O
by O
witnesses O
were O
, O
that O
the O
board O
of O
education O
, O
when O
first O
elected O
, O
proceeded O
to O
exercise O
the O
powers O
of O
the O
office O
and O
selected O
and O
bought O
the O
site O
and O
bought O
an O
old O
abandoned O
church O
building O
which O
had O
become O
unfit O
for O
church O
uses O
and O
moved O
it O
on O
the O
site. O
The O
old O
building O
was O
divided O
into O
two O
rooms O
, O
and O
the O
board O
built O
another O
temporary O
room O
adjoining O
, O
with O
sides O
boarded O
up O
and O
down O
like O
a O
barn O
and O
lined O
with O
what O
was O
called O
plaster-board O
, O
which O
is O
a O
combination O
of O
pasteboard O
and O
plaster. O
The O
board O
hired O
three O
teachers O
and O
had O
three O
departments O
with O
a O
regular O
four-year O
course. O
The O
school O
was O
opened O
in O
1920 O
with O
freshman O
, O
sophomore O
, O
junior O
and O
senior O
classes. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
trial O
there O
were O
twenty-eight O
scholars O
attending O
the O
school O
, O
with O
three O
in O
the O
senior O
class O
, O
due O
to O
graduate O
in O
1923 O
, O
and O
eleven O
scholars O
living O
in O
the O
district O
attended O
high O
schools O
outside O
of O
the O
district O
, O
in O
Carlinville O
, O
Greenfield O
, O
Palmyra O
or O
Shipman. O
The O
board O
of O
education O
levied O
a O
tax O
of O
$10 O
, O
000 O
in O
1920 O
, O
and O
the O
same O
amount O
was O
levied O
in O
1921 O
and O
1922. O
At O
some O
time O
in O
1922 O
, O
before O
the O
information O
was O
filed O
, O
an O
election O
was O
held O
to O
vote O
on O
the O
proposition O
of O
discontinuing O
the O
district O
, O
at O
which O
a O
majority O
voted O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
proposition O
, O
but O
the O
vote O
to O
discontinue O
was O
something O
less O
than O
two-thirds. O
The O
district O
is O
divided O
by O
three O
creeks. O
Hodges O
creek O
cuts O
off O
about O
one-half O
of O
the O
district O
on O
the O
east O
, O
and O
with O
considerable O
bottom O
land O
is O
subject O
to O
overflow O
and O
sometimes O
impassable. O
The O
two O
other O
creeks O
cut O
off O
about O
one-fourth O
of O
the O
district O
on O
the O
west O
. O
There O
is O
no O
indication O
of O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
decision O
and O
judgment O
of O
the O
court O
, O
but O
if O
it O
was O
justified O
in O
the O
law O
for O
any O
reason O
appearing O
in O
the O
record O
the O
judgment O
should O
be O
affirmed. O
A O

In O

much O

is O

given O
to O

from O

In O
this O
case O
the O
district O
was O
organized O
on O
February O
28 O
, O
1920 O
, O
and O
the O
information O
was O
filed O
at O
the O
June O
term O
, O
1922 O
, O
of O
the O
circuit O
court. O
In O
the O
meantime O
there O
had O
been O
an O
election O
to O
choose O
a O
site O
and O
the O
site O
had O
been O
selected O
and O
purchased. O
An O
issue O
of O
bonds O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
$30 O
, O
000 O
had O
been O
authorized O
on O
June O
5 O
, O
1920 O
, O
and O
a O
contract O
for O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
bonds O
had O
been O
made O
but O
not O
carried O
out O
because O
of O
a O
question O
concerning O
the O
legality O
of O
the O
district. O
The O
abandoned O
church O
building O
had O
been O
purchased O
and O
moved O
onto O
the O
site O
and O
the O
addition O
had O
been O
built O
, O
teachers O
had O
been O
hired O
and O
a O
school O
conducted O
, O
and O
annual O
levies O
of O
$10 O
, O
000 O
taxes O
had O
been O
made O
and O
collected. O
The O
cost O
of O
the O
site O
does O
not O
appear O
and O
the O
building O
was O
not O
extensive O
or O
of O
great O
value. O
A O
majority O
of O
the O
legal O
voters O
were O
opposed O
to O
continuing O
the O
district O
and O
sought O
to O
dissolve O
it O
by O
an O
election O
, O
but O
no O
weight O
can O
be O
given O
to O
that O
fact. O
The O
law O
assumes O
that O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
legal O
voters O
in O
compact O
and O
contiguous O
territory O
are O
*604competent O
to O
determine O
whether O
a O
community O

organized O

if O
under O

public O
benefits O
the O
majority O
vote O
for O
such O
organization O
, O
at O
least O
two-thirds O
must O
exercise O
their O
judgment O
to O
abandon O
or O
discontinue O
the O
district O
as O
contrary O
to O
the O
public O
interest. O
The O
proposition O
to O
discontinue O
this O
district O
failed O
for O
want O
of O
such O
a O
proportion O
of O
the O
voters. O
While O
the O
attempt O
to O
discontinue O
the O
district O
is O
not O
to O
be O
taken O
as O
a O
recognition O
of O
its O
legal O
existence O

January O

, O

, O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
filed O
its O
decision O
finding O
that O
Fred O
Wieman O
, O
as O
the O
result O

certain O

sustained O
while O
he O
was O
working O
in O
the O

, O
had O
suffered O

, O
under O
the O
provisions O

the O

, O
constituted O
total O

, O
and O
compensation O
and O
a O
pension O
for O
life O
were O
accordingly O
awarded. O
This O
decision O
was O
confirmed O
by O
the O
circuit O

and O
stands O
as O
a O
final O
adjudication O
of O
all O
questions O
in O
dispute O
at O
the O
time O
the O
decision O
was O
made. O
Thereafter O

its O

award O

that O

, O

on O

The O
proof O
of O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
that O
Wieman O
was O
not O
then O
totally O
blind O
and O
that O
he O
had O
been O
employed O
practically O
all O
the O
time O
since O
the O
award O
was O
made O
, O
as O
stableman O
to O
feed O
, O
harness O
and O
water O
mules O
in O
another O
mine O
, O
and O
had O
worked O
a O
few O
days O
as O
a O
mine O
examiner O
, O
was O
not O
disputed. O
He O
was O
paid O
a O
substantial O
wage O
for O
his O
services. O
He O
testified O
his O
eyesight O
was O
about O
the O
same O
at O
the O
time O
he O
testified O
as O
it O
was O
when O
the O
award O
was O
made. O
There O
was O
no O
other O
proof O
offered O
which O
in O
any O
way O
related O
to O
the O
condition O
of O
his O
eyesight O
at O
\u00a3he O
time O
the O
original O
award O
was O
made. O
Counsel O
for O
Wieman O
contend O
the O
proof O
showed O
that O
as O
the O
condition O
of O
his O
eyesight O
was O
the O
same O
as O
at O
the O
time O
the O
award O
was O
made O
there O
had O
been O
no O
decrease O
in O
the O
disability O
and O
therefore O
the O
petition O
was O
properly O
denied. O
Neither O
party O
is O
permitted O
in O
proceedings O
under O
paragraph O
(h) O
of O
section O
19 O
to O
be O
heard O
as O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
disability O
at O
the O
time O
the O
award O
was O
made. O
As O
we O
have O
said O
, O
the O
award O
, O
when O
it O
became O
final O
, O
settled O
the O
question O
of O
the O
nature O
and O
character O
of O
the O
disability O
then O
existing. O
The O
award O
made O
in O
this O
case O
settled O
the O
question O
that O
Wieman O
was O
totally O
blind O
and O
entitled O
to O
compensation O
on O
that O
basis O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
true O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
or O
not O
, O
and O
was O
equally O
binding O
on O
both O
parties. O
If O
on O
review O
it O
appeared O
from O
the O
proof O
that O
Wieman O
was O
not O
then O
blind O
, O
it O
would O
be O
conclusive O
evidence O
that O
the O
disability O
had O
diminished. O
Wieman O
did O
not O
deny O
on O
the O
last O
hear*124ing O
that O
he O
could O
then O
see O
and O
that O
he O
could O
and O
did O
perform O
labor O
for O
which O
he O
drew O
substantial O
wages O
, O
but O
he O
did O
testify O
his O
eyesight O
had O
not O
improved O
but O
was O
about O
the O
same O
then O
as O
it O
was O
when O
the O
original O
award O
was O
made. O
This O
was O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
an O
admission O
that O
his O
disability O
was O
not O
as O
great O
as O
the O
commission O
found O
it O
to O
be O
, O
and O
he O
claims O
there O
having O
been O
no O
change O
in O
his O
eyesight O
since O
the O
award O
was O
made O
, O
the O
commission O
was O
bound O
to O
find O
there O
had O
been O
no O
decrease O
in O
the O
disability O
and O
deny O
the O
petition. O
Wieman O
was O
as O
fully O
bound O
and O
concluded O
by O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
commission O
as O
to O
the O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
the O
disability O
as O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
It O
was O
no O
more O
competent O
for O
him O
to O
testify O
or O
prove O
what O
his O
condition O
was O
at O
that O
time O
than O
it O
would O
have O
been O
for O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
to O
have O
offered O
proof O
on O
that O
question. O
So O
far O
as O
the O
case O
on O
review O
was O
concerned O
, O
Wieman O
was O
totally O
blind O
when O
the O
award O
was O
made. O
It O
was O
not O
competent O
for O
either O
party O
to O
prove O
at O
the O
hearing O
on O
review O
that O
he O
was O
or O
was O
not O
blind O
when O
the O
award O
was O
made. O
The O
proof O
was O
required O
to O
be O
confined O
to O
the O
condition O
\u201eof O
his O
eyesight O
since O
the O
award O
was O
made O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
was O
adjudged O
totally O
blind. O
The O
uncontradicted O
proof O
shows O
that O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
hearing O
on O
review O
Wieman O
was O
not O
totally O
blind O
and O
showed O
there O
had O
been O
a O
decrease O
in O
his O
disability O
since O
the O
award O
was O
made. O
The O
Industrial O
Commission O
should O
have O
determined O
how O
much O
the O
disability O
had O
decreased O
instead O
of O
wholly O
denying O

Defendant O
appeals O
only O
his O
sentence O
. O
On O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
argues O
that O
the O
sentence O
was O
improper O
*230because O
the O
charging O
instrument O
failed O
to O
notify O
defendant O
of O
the O
State\u2019s O

the O

We O
disagree. O
Directly O
on O
point O
is O
People O
v. O
Contreras O
(1993) O
, O
241 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
1023 O
, O
a O
case O
neither O
party O
cites. O
Contreras O
held O
that O
the O
notification O
requirement O
of O
section O
111 O
\u2014 O
3(c) O
does O
not O
apply O
where O
a O
sentence O
is O
enhanced O
pursuant O
to O
section O
5 O
\u2014 O
5\u20143(c)(8) O
of O
the O
Unified O
Code O
of O
Corrections O
, O
as O
under O
the O
latter O
provision O
, O
the O
prior O
convictions O
increase O
only O
the O
sentence O
and O
not O
the O
classification O
of O
the O
offense O
itself. O
The O
court O
noted O
that O
, O
although O
section O
111 O
\u2014 O
3(c) O
addresses O
the O
situation O
where O
the O
State O
seeks O
an O
"enhanced O
sentence O
, O
\u201d O
the O
provision O
then O
defines O
"enhanced O
sentence\u201d O
as O
an O
enhanced O
classification O
of O
the O
offense. O
Notwithstanding O
that O
the O
drafters O
of O
section O
111 O
\u2014 O
3(c) O
might O
have O
saved O
confusion O
by O
using O
the O
phrase O
"enhanced O
classification\u201d O
throughout O
, O
we O
agree O
with O
Contreras O
that O
the O
language O
requiring O
notification O
is O
inapplicable O
in O
a O
case O
such O
as O
this O
one O
, O
where O
the O
classification O
of O
the O
offense O
itself O
has O
never O
been O
enhanced. O

, O
256 O
Ill. O

, O

, O
following O
Contreras O
. O
We O
must O
modify O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
judgment O
in O
one O
respect. O
Although O
neither O
party O
has O
raised O
the O
issue O
, O
the O
court\u2019s O
written O
"Judgment O
and O
Sentence\u201d O
of O
January O
28 O
, O
1993 O
, O
incorrectly O
states O
that O
defendant O
was O
convicted O
of O
a O
Class O
X O
felony. O
As O
we O
have O
explained O
, O
defendant O
was O
convicted O
of O
a O
Class O
2 O
felony O
, O
but O
he O
was O
sentenced O
as O
a O
Class O
X O
offender. O
After O
reviewing O
the O
transcript O
of O
the O
sentencing O
hearing O
, O
we O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
sentencing O
judge O
was O
aware O
of O
this O
distinction O
and O
that O
the O
statement O
in O
the O
January O
28 O
, O
1993 O
, O
order O
was O
an O
oversight. O
Thus O
, O
on O
our O
own O
motion O
, O
we O
vacate O
that O
part O
of O
the O
order O
stating O
that O
defendant O
was O
convicted O
of O
a O
Class O
X O
felony O
and O
modify O
it O
to O
state O
that O
defendant O
was O
convicted O
of O
a O
Class O
2 O
felony. O
In O
all O
other O
respects O
, O
defendant\u2019s O
conviction O

PRESIDING B-A
JUSTICE I-A
INGLIS I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Petitioner O
, O
Janice O
T. O
Kent O

appeals O
the O
order O
of O
the O
circuit O

of O
Kane O

denying O

Illinois O
Marriage O
and O
Dissolution O
of O
Marriage O
Act. O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/508 O
(West O

Petitioner O
contends O
that O
the O
court O
improperly O
dismissed O
her O
petition O
for O
lack O
of O
jurisdiction. O
We O
reverse O
and O
remand O
. O
On O
November O
30 O
, O
1989 O
, O
petitioner O
filed O
a O
petition O
for O
dissolution O
of O
marriage O
against O
respondent O
, O
Floyd O
G. O
Kent. O
A O
property O
settlement O
agreement O
was O
incorporated O
into O
the O
judgment O
for O
dissolution O
entered O
on O
January O
11 O
, O
1991. O
Pursuant O
to O
the O
settlement O
agreement O
, O
respondent O
was O
to O
pay O
petitioner O
the O
sum O
of O
$20 O
, O
000 O
in O
exchange O
for O
petitioner\u2019s O

of O
the O
equity O
in O
their O
home O
. O
On O
March O
31 O
, O
1992 O
, O
respondent O
filed O
a O
petition O
for O
bankruptcy O
in O
the O
bankruptcy O
court O
for O
the O
northern O
district O
of O
Illinois O
, O
listing O
petitioner O
as O
a O
creditor. O
On O
April O
10 O
, O
1992 O
, O
respondent O
filed O
an O
adversary O
complaint O
in O
the O
bankruptcy O
court O
against O
petitioner O
seeking O
discharge O
of O
his O
obligation O
to O
pay O
the O
$20 O
, O
000 O
owed O
pursuant O
to O
the O
settlement O
agreement. O
In O
response O
to O
the O
complaint O
, O
petitioner O
retained O
the O
services O
of O
her O
attorney O
, O
who O
represented O
petitioner O
in O
the O
bankruptcy O
proceeding. O
The O
bankruptcy O
court O
dismissed O

petition O
and O
complaint O
on O
July O
7 O
, O
1993 O
. O
On O
July O
12 O
, O
1993 O
, O
petitioner O
filed O
a O
petition O
for O
attorney O
fees O
incurred O
in O
the O
bankruptcy O
proceeding O
, O
seeking O
that O
respondent O
be O
required O
to O
pay O
petitioner\u2019s O
attorney O
fees O
pursuant O
to O
section O
508 O
of O

Illinois O
Marriage O
and O
Dissolution O
of O
Marriage O
Act O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/508 O
(West O
1992)). O
Respondent O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O
strike O
the O
petition O
for O
attorney O
fees O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
had O
no O
jurisdiction O
to O
award O
attorney O
fees O
incurred O
in O
a O
bankruptcy O
proceeding. O
The O
court O
granted O
respondent\u2019s O
motion O
, O
holding O
that O
it O
did O
not O
have O
jurisdiction O
to O
award O
attorney O
fees. O
We O
disagree O
. O
Section O
508(b) O
of O
the O
Illinois O
Marriage O
and O
Dissolution O
of O
Marriage O
Act O
states: O
"In O
every O
proceeding O
for O
the O
enforcement O
of O
an O
order O
or O
judgment O
when O
the O
court O
finds O
that O
the O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
order O
or O
judgment O
was O
without O
cause O
or O
justification O
, O
the O
court O
shall O
order O
the O
party O
against O
whom O
the O
proceeding O
is O
brought O
to O
pay O
the O
costs O
and O
reasonable O
attorney\u2019s O
fees O
of O
the O
prevailing O
party.\u201d O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/508(b) O
(West O
1992).) O
Respondent O
argued O
that O
the O
above O
statute O
does O
not O
grant O
the O
circuit O
court O
jurisdiction O
to O
enter O
an O
award O
of O
attorney O
fees O
incurred O
in O
a O
bankruptcy O
proceeding O
. O
The O
quoted O
statute O
authorizes O
fee O
awards O
"[i]n O
every O
proceeding O
for O
the O
enforcement O
of O
an O
order.\u201d O
(Emphasis O
added.) O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/508(b) O
(West O
1992).) O
The O
plain O
meaning O
of O
the O
statute O
allows O
the O
recovery O
of O
fees O
incurred O
in O
any O
proceeding O
that O
has O
as O
its O
goal O
the O
enforcement O
of O
an O
order O
or O
judgment O
entered O
in O
a O
dissolution O
proceeding. O
In O
a O
similar O
situation O
, O
we O
held O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
erred O
in O
automatically O
denying O
attorney O
fees O
in O
a O
proceeding O
brought O
in O
a O
different O
forum O
than O
the O
dissolution O
court. O
(In O
re O
Marriage O
of O
Sanda O
(1993) O
, O
245 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
314 O
, O
321.) O
In O
Sanda O
, O
the O
court O
noted O
that O
the O
plain O
meaning O
of O
the O
statute O
required O
the O
circuit O
court O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
corollary O
proceeding O
was O
brought O
to O
enforce O
a O
dissolution O
order O
, O
and O
if O
so O
, O
whether O
it O
was O
brought O
in O
good O
faith. O
Sanda O
, O
245 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
321 O
. O
We O
find O
no O
authority O
to O
indicate O
that O
fees O
incurred O
in O
the O
bankruptcy O
proceeding O
automatically O
do O
not O
fall O
under O
the O
statutory O
scheme O
of O
section O
508. O
The O
mere O
fact O
that O
the O
fees O
were O
incurred O
in O
a O
Federal O
court O
does O
not O
remove O
said O
fees O
from O
the O
purview O
of O
the O
statute O
. O
Respondent O
filed O
his O
bankruptcy O
petition O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
discharge O
his O
debts O
and O
obligations. O
One O
of O
those O
obligations O
was O
the O
settlement O
agreement. O
Petitioner O
procured O
counsel O
in O
order O
to O
enforce O
the O
dissolution O
property O
settlement. O
The O
fact O
that O
this O
occurred O
in O
the O
bankruptcy O
court O
does O
not O
divest O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
jurisdiction O
to O
determine O
whether O
petitioner O
is O
entitled O
to O
attorney O
fees O
pursuant O
to O
section O
508. O
750 O
ILCS O
5/508 O
(West O
1992) O
. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
did O
have O
jurisdiction O
to O
award O
*145attorney O
fees O
pursuant O
to O
section O
508(b). O
We O
are O
unable O
, O
however O
, O
to O
determine O
whether O
attorney O
fees O
should O
have O
been O
awarded. O
In O
order O
for O
petitioner O
to O
recover O
attorney O
fees O
pursuant O
to O
section O
508(b) O
, O
respondent\u2019s O
failure O
to O
comply O
with O
the O
settlement O
agreement O
must O
have O
been O
without O
justification O
or O
without O
cause. O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/508(b) O
(West O

We O

Mr. B-A

of O
the O

By O
leave O
of O

an O
information O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
quo O

was O
filed O
in O
the O

of O
Cook O

in O
the O
name O
of O
the O
People O
, O
on O
the O
relation O
of O
Thomas O

George O

McEldowney O
and O

, O
claiming O

calling O
upon O
them O
to O
show O
by O
what O
warrant O
they O
claimed O
to O
hold O
and O
execute O
such O
offices. O
The O
respondents O
filed O
a O
plea O
setting O
up O
the O
proceedings O
taken O
for O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
district. O
A O
demurrer O
to O
the O
plea O
was O
over*576ruled O
, O
and O
the O
relator O
electing O
to O
stand O
by O
his O
demurrer O
the O
court O
dismissed O
the O
information O
, O
and O
the O
relator O
appealed O
. O
No O
objection O
was O
made O
to O
the O
regularity O
of O
the O
proceedings O
, O
but O
it O
is O
insisted O
that O
they O
are O
invalid O
because O
of O
the O
insufficiency O
of O
the O
petition O
for O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
Chicago O
Heights O
Park O
District O
in O
failing O
to O
clearly O
and O
definitely O
set O
forth O
the O
boundaries. O
The O
petition O
described O
the O
territory O
intended O
to O
be O
embraced O
in O
the O
park O
district O
as O
all O
those O
parts O
of O
sections O

said O
territory O
that O
are O
now O
included O
in O
the O
Forest O

District O
of O
Cook O
county O
, O
Illinois. O
The O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
of O
Cook O
county O
is O
co-terminous O
with O
Cook O
county O
, O
as O
we O
take O
judicial O
notice O
by O
virtue O
of O
section O
3 O
of O
the O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
act. O
The O
entire O
city O
of O
Chicago O
Heights O
is O
therefore O
included O
within O
the O
limits O
of O
the O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
of O
Cook O
county O
, O
and O
the O
exemption O
mentioned O
in O
the O
petition O
, O
literally O
understood O
, O
would O
have O
the O
absurd O
effect O
of O
excepting O
all O
the O
land O
which O
the O
petition O
prayed O
should O
be O
organized O
into O
the O
Chicago O
Heights O
Park O
District. O
The O
petition O
was O
intended O
to O
have O
some O
effect O
, O
and O
if O
such O
effect O
can O
be O
given O
it O
as O
is O
within O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
petition O
, O
its O
language O
may O
be O
departed O
from O
to O
avoid O
an O
absurd O
conclusion. O
The O
limits O
of O
the O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
of O
Cook O
county O
are O
the O
limits O
of O
Cook O
county O
, O
but O
the O
district O
is O
not O
authorized O
to O
exercise O
its O
jurisdiction O
over O
any O
of O
the O
territory O
of O
that O
county O
until O
, O
in O
the O
manner O
provided O
by O
the O
statute O
, O
it O
has O
acquired O
land O
for O
that O
purpose. O
The O
statute O
provides O
in O
section O
5 O
that O
any O
forest O
preserve O
district O
organized O
under O
the O
act O
shall O
have O
the O
power O
to O
create O
forest O
preserves O
, O
and O
for O
that O
purpose O
to O
acquire O
and O
hold O
lands O
containing O
one O
or O
more O
natural O
forests O
or O
parts O
thereof O
, O
or O
connecting O
such O
forests O
or O
parts O
thereof O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
for O
*577which O
such O
district O
was O
created; O
and O
in O
subsequent O
sections O
the O
jurisdiction O
and O
authority O
of O
the O
commissioners O
of O
the O
district O
over O
the O
land O
so O
acquired O
are O
defined. O
The O
plea O
alleges O
that O
at O
the O
time O
of O
filing O
the O
petition O
for O
the O
organization O
of O
the O
Chicago O
Heights O
Park O
District O
, O
and O
at O
all O
times O
afterwards O
, O
the O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
of O
Cook O
county O
owned O
and O
had O
possession O
of O
a O
tract O
of O
land O
situated O
within O
the O
corporate O
limits O
of O
the O
city O
of O
Chicago O
Heights O
, O
which O
the O
plea O
describes O
, O
containing O
approximately O
fifteen O
acres O
of O
land O
, O
and O
that O
it O
was O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
voters O
of O
Chicago O
Heights O
who O
filed O
a O
petition O
for O
the O
organization O
of O
a O
park O
district O
to O
exclude O
from O
the O
district O
the O
territory O
described O
, O
owned O
by O
the O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
of O
Cook O
county O
. O
While O
the O
language O
used O
in O
excepting O
from O
the O
parts O
of O
sections O
19 O
, O
20 O
, O
21 O
, O
28 O
and O
29 O
the O
portions O
of O
territory O
not O
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
park O
district O
was O
not O
the O
most O
apt O
for O
that O
purpose O
, O
still O
, O
as O
ordinarily O
understood O
, O
it O
would O
leave O
no O
doubt O
of O
the O
intention O
of O
the O
signers O
of O
the O
petition. O
\u201cIncluded O
in O
the O
Forest O
Preserve O
District O
of O
Cook O
county\u201d O
may O
be O
understood O
in O
different O
senses. O
It O
may O
have O
more O
than O
one O
meaning. O
Technically O
it O
means O
within O
the O
legal O
boundaries O
of O
the O
district; O
popularly O
it O
may O
mean O
included O
in O
the O
land O
over O
which O
the O
commissioners O
of O
the O
district O
have O
assumed O
jurisdiction O
and O
are O
exercising O
authority. O
A O
rule O
for O
the O
interpretation O
of O
statutes O
is O
that O
they O
must O
be O
interpreted O
according O
to O
the O
intent O
and O
meaning O
and O
not O
always O
according O
to O
the O
letter. O
A O
thing O
within O
the O
intention O
is O
within O
the O
statute O
though O
not O
within O
the O
letter O
, O
and O
a O
thing O
within O
the O
letter O
is O
not O
within O
the O
statute O
unless O
within O
the O
intention. O
It O
was O
said O
in O
Perry O
County O
v. O
Jefferson O
County O
, O
94 O
Ill. O
214: O
\u201cThere O
is O
sufficient O
authority O
to O
warrant O
departure O
from O
the O
words O
of O
a O
statute O
when O
to O
follow O
them O
would O
lead O
to O
an O
absurd O
consequence.\u201d O
The O
same O
principle O
applies O
in O
this O
case. O
If O
the O
words O
referred O
to O
are O
given O
their O
technical O
meaning O
the O
petition O
is O
meaningless O
and O
*578absurd; O
it O
can O
have O
no O
effect O
whatever. O
If O
they O
are O
taken O
in O
the O
ordinary O
and O
popular O
sense O
the O
meaning O
of O
the O
petition O
is O
perfectly O
plain. O
The O
petition O
is O
signed O
by.the O
voters O
, O
it O
is O
to O
be O
presumed O
, O
having O
some O
reasonable O
intention. O
It O
was O
considered O
by O
the O
county O
court O
not O
as O
a O
meaningless O
paper O
but O
as O
a O
petition O
calling O
for O
official O
action O
, O
the O
election O
was O
ordered O
and O
upon O
the O
canvass O
of O
the O
returns O
the O
court O
made O
an O
order O
declaring O
the O
park O
district O
established O
by O
the O
same O
description O
contained O
in O
the O
petition. O
The O
words O
, O
\u201cincluded O
in O
the O
Forest O

of O
Cook' O

, O
\u201d O

Plaintiffs O
in O

Charles O

Philip O
Davis O
, O
were O
convicted O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O

of O
the O
charge O
of O
rape O
upon O
Sylvia O

They O
have O
brought O
the O
record O
here O
for O
review O
, O
urging O
that O
the O
verdict O
is O
contrary O
to O
the O
evidence O
and O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
instructing O
the O
jury O
. O
The O
undisputed O
facts O
are O
that O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
the O
25th O
day O
of O
February O
, O
1921 O
, O
the O
complaining O
witness O
, O
Sylvia O
*211Welle O
, O
who O
was O
then O
seventeen O
years O
of O
age O
and O
a O
student O
in O
the O
high O
school O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Virden O
, O
with O
a O
companion O
, O
Margaret O
Love O
, O
(now O
Margaret O
Monts O
, O
) O
attended O
a O
basket O
ball O
game O
at O
the O
high O
school O
gymnasium O
in O
that O
city. O
At O
about O
nine O
o\u2019clock O
, O
after O
the O
game O
was O
over O
, O
they O
went O
with O
the O
crowd O
down-town O
, O
intending O
, O
as O
they O
testified O
, O
to O
get O
refreshments O
in O
an O
ice O
cream O
parlor. O
On O
the O
way O
from O
the O
school O
building O
to O
the O
business O
part O
of O
the O
city O
these O
girls O
were O
approached O
by O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
and O
Ralph O
Bell. O
Davis O
made O
some O
inquiry O
of O
the O
complaining O
witness O
about O
the O
referee O
of O
the O
game. O
The O
girls O
continued O
on O
their O
way O
and O
were O
followed O
by O
the O
young O
men. O
Davis O
was O
about O
nineteen O
years O
of O
age O
, O
a O
coal O
miner O
by O
occupation O
, O
and O
White O
, O
who O
was O
twenty-two O
years O
of O
age O
, O
was O
a O
barber. O
Bell O
, O
twenty-three O
years O
of O
age O
, O
was O
also O
a O
coal O
miner. O
The O
girls O
were O
not O
acquainted O
with O
these O
young O
men. O
They O
left O
them O
immediately O
upon O
the O
inquiry O
by O
Davis O
and O
went O
to O
the O
interurban O
depot O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
, O
as O
they O
testify O
, O
of O
avoiding O
Davis O
and O
Bell O
, O
who O
followed O
them. O
When O
they O
came O
out O
Davis O
and O
B\u00e9ll O
were O
waiting O
outside O
and O
followed O
them O
toward O
their O
homes O
and O
on O
overtaking O
them O
insisted O
on O
accompanying O
them. O
When O
the O
neighborhood O
of O
the O
residence O
of O
Margaret O
Love O
was O
reached O
the O
young O
men O
insisted O
upon O
these O
girls O
walking O
with O
them. O
The O
party O
proceeded O
to O
a O
wooded O
square O
called O
the O
City O
Park. O
Upon O
entering O
the O
park O
the O
couples O
became O
separated. O
Davis O
and O
the O
complaining O
witness O
went O
toward O
the O
southeast O
corner O
of O
the O
park O
, O
where O
the O
intercourse O
complained O
of O
took O
place O
. O
Complaining O
witness O
testified O
that O
Davis O
threw O
her O
to O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
as O
they O
were O
struggling O
there O
he O
whistled O
, O
and O
White O
came O
up O
and O
held O
his O
hands O
over O
her O
mouth O
while O
Davis O
ravished O
her; O
that O
Davis O
then O
held O
her O
while O
White O
also O
raped O
her; O
that O
later O
Bell O
and O
the O
Love O
girl O
came O
over O
to O
where O
they O
were.. O
The O
Love O
girl O
testified O
that O
when O
she O
and O
Bell O
came O
up O
they O
found O
the O
prosecuting O
witness O
crying O
and O
greatly O
excited. O
White O
disappeared O
about O
*212that O
time. O
Bell O
and O
Davis O
went O
with O
the O
girls O
to O
the O
alley O
about O
half O
a O
block O
from O
where O
the O
Love O
girl O
lived. O
Complaining O
witness O
remained O
that O
night O
at O
the O
home O
of O
the O
Love O
girl O
and O
told O
her O
what O
had O
occurred. O
The O
State\u2019s O
evidence O
also O
shows O
that O
the O
family O
physician O
of O
the O
Welle O
family O
found O
, O
upon O
examination O
, O
indications O
of O
intercourse O
having O
been O
had O
with O
her. O
The O
following O
evening O
the O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
, O
with O
Bell O
, O
left O
Virden O
, O
walking O
to O
the O
village O
of O
Thayer O
, O
where O
they O
took O
an O
interurban O
car. O
for O
Springfield O
and O
went O
from O
there O
to O
Chicago. O
The O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
testified O
that O
their O
going O
to O
Chicago O
was O
because O
they O
had O
heard O
that O
a O
warrant O
had O
been O
issued O
for O
them. O
Davis O
and O
White O
admit O
having O
intercourse O
with O
the O
complaining O
witness O
but O
testify O
that O
it O
was O
without O
force O
and O
was O
with O
her O
consent. O
Two O
witnesses O
were O
also O
offered O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
defense O
who O
testified O
that O
they O
passed O
the O
park O
about O
the O
time O
the O
alleged O
rape O
took O
place O
and O
that O
they O
saw O
no O
struggle O
and O
heard O
no O
outcries. O
Two O
of O
these O
witnesses O
testified O
that O
they O
saw O
two O
persons O
on O
the O
ground O
in O
this O
corner O
of O
the O
park O
. O
The O
question O
of O
the O
guilt O
or O
innocence O
of O
the O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
was O
one O
of O
fact O
for O
the O
jury. O
The O
Love O
girl O
corroborated O
the O
prosecuting O
witness O
concerning O
the O
latter\u2019s O
condition O
when O
the O
witness O
and O
Bell O
came O
up. O
It O
is O
not O
reasonable O
to O
suppose O
that O
a O
school O
girl O
who O
, O
as O
the O
evidence O
tends O
to O
show O
, O
had O
never O
before O
engaged O
in O
acts O
of O
illicit O
intercourse O
should O
willingly O
submit O
herself O
to O
the O
embraces O
of O
two O
men O
who O
were O
strangers O
to O
her. O
We O
cannot O
say O
that O
the O
verdict O
of O
the O
jury O
finding O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
guilty O
of O
rape O
is O
so O
manifestly O
against O
the O
weight O
of O
the O
evidence O
as O
to O
justify O
disturbing O
it O
. O
The O
court O
gave O
seven O
instructions O
for O
the O
State O
and O
eleven O
for O
the O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
and O
refused O
eleven O
instructions O
offered O
on O
behalf O
of O
plaintiffs O
in O
error. O
They O
contend O
that O
the O
refusal O
of O
these O
instructions O
was O
error. O
They O
complain O
in O
argument O
in O
their O
briefs O
, O
however O
, O
as O
to O
but O
one O
*213of O
these O
refused O
instructions O
, O
referred O
to O
as O
the O
fifth O
refused O
instruction. O
This O
instruction O
told O
the O
jury O
that O
the O
indictment O
charged O
the O
defendants O
with O
rape O
upon O
the O
person O
of O
the O
prosecuting O
witness O
with O
force O
, O
and O
that O
force O
is O
a O
constituent O
, O
essential O
element O
of O
the O
crime O
charged O
and O
must O
be O
established O
by O
evidence O
beyond O
all O
reasonable O
doubt. O
This O
instruction O
is O
a O
correct O
statement O
of O
the O
law. O
An O
examination O
of O
the O
instructions O
given O
, O
however O
, O
discloses O
that O
instruction O

given O
on O
behalf O
of O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
defined O
the O
term O
\u201cforce.\u201d O
Instruction O
16 O
given O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
plaintiffs O
in O
error O
told O
the O
jury O
that O
unless O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
prosecution O
had O
established O
by O
evidence O
beyond O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
that O
the O
defendants O
, O
or O
one O
of O
them O
, O
raped O
Sylvia O
Welle O
with O
, O
force O
, O
in O
manner O
and O
form O
as O
charged O
in O
the O
indictment O
, O
the O
jury O
should O
find O
them O
not O
guilty. O
Given O
instruction O
18 O
told O
the O
jury O
that O
if O
they O
believed O
that O
the O
acts O
of O
intercourse O
were O
consummated O
by O
her O
consent O
and O
not O
forcibly O
and O
against O
her O
will O
the O
defendants O
could O
not O
be O
convicted O
, O
and O
that O
the O
use O
of O
force O
was O
a O
constituent O
element O
, O
and O
unless O
proven O
beyond O
all O
reasonable O
doubt O
the O
jury O
should O
acquit O
the O
defendants. O
The O
instruction O
refused O
was O
given O
in O
substance O
in O
these O
instructions. O
While O
the O
refusal O
of O
other O
instructions O
is O
not O
argued O
, O
we O
have O
examined O
all O
given O
and O
refused O
instructions O
and O
find O
that O
all O
correct O
propositions O
of O
law O
in O
the O
refused O
instructions O
were O
contained O
in O
given O
instructions. O
Neither O
the O
State O
nor O
the O

is O

a O
repetition O
of O
instructions O
, O
and O
to O
re-state O

Mr. B-A
Chief I-A
Justice I-A
Thompson I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Thawville O
Community O
High O
School O
District O
was O
organized O
in O
1920 O
and O
maintained O
a O
high O
school O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Thawville O
, O
in O
Iroquois O
county O
, O
during O
the O
school O
year O
1920-1921. O
Immediately O
east O
of O
the O
Thawville O
district O
lies O
Onarga O
Township O
High O
School O
District O
, O
which O
was O
organized O
several O
years O
earlier O
and O
which O
during O
all O
the O
time O
of O
its O
existence O
has O
maintained O
a O
high O
school O
in O
the O
village O
of O
Onarga. O
The O
Onarga O
district O
lies O
entirely O
within O
Iroquois O
county O
but O
the O
Thawville O
district O
includes O
twelve O
and O
one-half O
sections O
lying O
in O
Ford O
county. O
Acting O
under O
the O
authority O
granted O
in O
section O
96 O
of O
the O
School O
law O
, O
(Laws O
of O
1917 O
, O
p. O
743 O
, O
) O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Iroquois O
county O
granted O
a O
certificate O
of O
convenience O
to O
seven O
pupils O
living O
in O
the O
Thawville O
district O
, O
thereby O
approving O
their O
attendance O
at O
the O
Onarga O
high O
school. O
This O
certificate O
was O
granted O
without O
notice O
to O
or O
the O
knowledge O
of O
the O
Thawville O
district O
and O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Ford O
county O
was O
\u25a0 O
not O
requested O
or O
obtained. O
All O
of O
the O
pupils O
transferred O
lived O
nearer O
their O
home O
school O
, O
\u2014 O
one O
of O
them O
a O
quarter O
of O
a O
mile O
, O
two O
of O
them O
a O
half O
mile O
, O
one O
of O
them O
a O
mile O
, O
and O
two O
of O
them O
three O
and O
a O
quarter O
miles. O
The O
seventh O
pupil O
lived O
within O
three O
blocks O
of O
the O
Thawville O
high O
school O
and O
eight O
miles O
from O
the O
Onarga O
high O
school. O
From O
the O
evidence O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
reasons O
which O
prompted O
the O
action O
of O
.the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
were O
that O
five O
of O
the O
pupils O
had O
there*233tofore O
attended O
Onarga O
high O
school O
, O
that O
they O
could O
get O
instruction O
in O
subjects O
at O
Onarga O
which O
they O
could O
not O
get O
at O
Thawville O
, O
and O
that O
Onarga O
had O
superior O
advantages O
because O
it O
had O
been O
longer O
established O
, O
had O
a O
larger O
faculty O
, O
had O
more O
elective O
courses O
and O
was O
accredited. O
The O
Thaw-ville O
district O
refused O
to O
pay O
the O
tuition O
demanded O
, O
and O
the O
board O
of O
education O
of O
the O
Onarga O
district O
brought O
an O
action O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Iroquois O
county O
to O
recover O
the O
amount O
claimed O
to O
be O
due. O
The O
circuit O
court O
gave O
judgment O
for O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
amount O
claimed O
, O
and O
this O
appeal O
followed O
. O
The O
circuit O
court O
held O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
\u201cthat O
as O
Iroquois O
county O
is O
the O
county O
in O
which O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
territory O
of O
the O
defendant O
district O
is O
situated O
, O
the O
approvals O
which O
are O
in O
evidence O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Iroquois O
county O
were O
made O
by O
the O
proper O
officer O
for O
the O
high O
school O
pupils O
of O
the O
defendant O
district O
in O
question O
to O
attend O
plaintiff\u2019s O
high O
school O
, O
and O
that O
the O
law O
did O
not O
require O
said O
pupils O
to O
have O
the O
approval O
of O
the. O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Ford O
county.\u201d O
Section O
96 O
provides O
that O
\u201cupon O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
, O
any O
high O
school O
pupil O
may O
attend O
a O
recognized O
high O
school O
more O
convenient O
in O
some O
district O
other O
than O
the O
high O
school O
district O
in O
which O
he O
resides.\u201d O
This O
statute O
must O
be O
construed O
so O
that O
it O
will O
apply O
to O
all O
high O
school O
districts O
in O
the O
State O
, O
thereby O
giving O
effect O
to O
the O
manifest O
legislative O
intent. O
For O
instance O
, O
it O
must O
be O
applicable O
where O
the O
resident O
district O
lies O
in O
one O
county O
and O
the O
district O
to O
which O
the O
transfer O
is O
made O
lies O
in O
another O
county; O
where O
the O
one O
district O
lies O
wholly O
in O
one O
county O
and O
the O
other O
lies O
in O
two O
adjoining O
counties; O
where O
the O
territory O
in O
each O
district O
is O
equally O
divided O
between O
two O
adjoining O
counties; O
where O
one O
of O
the O
districts O
has O
its O
territory O
divided O
equally O
among O
three O
adjoining O
counties O
or O
among O
four O
counties O
which O
corner; O
and O
any O
other O
number O
of O
situations O
which O
might O
be O
described. O
It O
is O
manifest O
, O
therefore O
, O
that O
the O
well O
recognized O
*234canon O
of O
statutory O
construction O
that O
\u201cwords O
importing O
the O
singular O
number O
may O
extend O
and O
be O
applied O
to O
several O
persons\u201d O
should O
be O
applied O
to O
this O
section O
, O
so O
that O
where O
the O
two O
districts O
involved O
lie O
in O
more O
than O
one O
county O
the O
pupil O
must O
have O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendents O
of O
all O
the O
counties O
involved O
before O
he O
may O
attend O
a O
high O
school O
in O
a O
district O
other O
than O
the O
one O
in O
which O
he O
resides O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
his O
district. O
For O
that O
reason O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
holding O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Ford O
county. O
Before O
liability O
could O
attach O
to O
the O
Thawville O
district O
to O
pay O
the O
'tuition O
of O
any O
of O
the O
pupils O
residing O
in O
that O
district O
and O
attending O
school O
at O
Onarga O
it O
was O
necessary O
for O
the O
county O
superintendents O
of O
schools O
of O
Iroquois O
and O
Ford O
counties O
to O
certify O
that O
it O
was O
more O
convenient O
for O
said O
pupils O
to O
attend O
the O
high O
school O
in O
the O
Onarga O
district O
than O
the O
one O
in O
the O

For O
want O
of O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Ford O
county O
the O
Thaw-ville O
district O
was O
not O
liable O
for O
the O
tuition O
involved O
and O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
entering O
judgment O
against O
it O
. O
It O
is O
further O
contended O
that O
section O
96 O
is O
unconstitutional O
because O
it O
attempts O
to O
vest O
in O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
legislative O
power O
by O
permitting O
him O
to O
decide O
when O
it O
is O
\u201cmore O
convenient\u201d O
for O
a O
pupil O
to O
attend O
one O
school O
than O
another O
without O
placing O
any O
bounds O
or O

on O
the O

that O
it O
is O
a O
special O
law O
with O
respect O

that O

Weicker O
procured O

On O
August O
20 O
, O
1921 O
, O
Hess O
and O
Weicker O
met O
at O
the O
office O
of O
the O
real O
estate O
broker O
, O
and O
after O
some O
discussion O
about O
prorating O
taxes O
the O
contract O
provided O
that O
$1000 O
was O
to O
be O
paid O
by O
Hess O
and O
$17 O
, O
000 O
was O
to O
be O
paid O
when O
a O
good O
and O
sufficient O
general O
warranty O
deed O
was O
ready O
for O
delivery O
, O
and O
the O
taxes O
for O
the O
year O
1921 O
were O
to O
be O
prorated O
at O
the O
date O
of O
the O
delivery O
of O
the O
deed. O
The O
contract O
was O
signed O
by O
Hess O
and O
Weicker O
and O
was O
afterwards O
signed O
by O
their O
respective O
wives. O
The O
$1000 O
was O
paid O
and O
Weicker O
gave O
a O
receipt O
for O
it O
, O
the O
money O
to O
be O
applied O
on O
the O
contract. O
The O
legal O
description O

, O
\u2014 O
a O
subdivision O
of O

The O
contract O
as O

was O
for O
the O
conveyance O
of O
that O
lot O
by O
such O
description O
, O
\u201cexcept O
the O
east O
four O

covered O
a O

over O
25 O

part O
of O
the O
lot O
, O
and O
on O
the O

part O
, O
excepted O
in O
the O
contract O
, O
there O
was O
a O

with O
air-shafts O

the O
building O
near O
the O

and O
leading O
to O
a O
woodshed O
at O
the O
rear O
of O
the O
lot. O
In O
September O
, O
1921 O
, O
Hess O
learned O
of O
the O
fraud O
which O
had O
been O
practiced O
upon O
him O
by O
the O
exception O
written O
in O
the O
contract O
and O
refused O
to O
accept O
a O
deed O
under O
the O
contract. O
He O
filed O
his O
bill O
against O
Weicker O
and O
his O
.wife O
, O
and O
afterward O
amended O
it O
by O
adding O
his O
"wife O
, O
Martha O
, O
as O
a O
complainant O
because O
she O
had O
signed O
the O
Contract. O
The O
bill O
as O
amended O
sought O
a O
cancellation O
of O
the O
contract O
and O
performance O
of O
the O
option. O
The O
chancellor O
heard O
the O
evidence O
, O
canceled O
the O
contract O
and O
decreed O
specific-performance O
of O
the O
option O
, O
requiring O
the O
defendants O
to O
convey O
the O
premises O
upon O
the O
tender O
of O
$17 O
, O
000 O
, O
with O
interest O
from O
September O
20 O
, O
1921 O
, O
at O
six O
per O
cent O
, O
together O
with O
whatever O
amounts O
the O
defendants O
might O
*273have O
paid O
for O
the O
general O
taxes O
for O
the O
year O
1921 O
and O
for O
installments O
of O
special O
assessments O
unpaid O
on O
August O
20 O
, O
1921 O
, O
deducting O
from O
such O
amount O
so O
to O
be O
paid O
the O
rents O
collected O
by O
the O
defendants O
from O
September O
20 O
, O
1921 O
, O
to O
which O
rent O
had O
been O
paid O
up O
to O
the O
date O
when O
the O
tender O
should O
be O
made O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
contract O
as O
written O
by O
the O
real O
estate O
broker O
and O
executed O
by O
the O
parties.was O
not O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
option O
contained O
in O
the O
lease O
under O
which O
Fred O
Hess O
had O
given O
his O
notice O
is O
not O
denied. O
The O
only O
effort O
made O
at O
the O
hearing O
or O
upon O
this O
appeal O
to O
prevent O
relief O
against O
the O
fraud O
is O
that O
the O
complainants O
were O
negligent O
in O
not O
discovering O
it. O
The O
abstract O
furnished O
by O
the O
appellants O
disregards O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
court O
for O
the O
evident O
purpose O
of O
presenting O
that O
alleged O
defense. O
It O
omits O
or O
abbreviates O
testimony O
for O
the O
complainants O
showing O
that O
they O
were O
not O
negligent O
and O
sets O
forth O
testimony O
for O
the O
defendants O
at O
length O
by O
questions O
and O
answers. O
Nearly O
all O
of O
the O
argument O
is O
taken O
up O
with O
questions O
and O
answers O
of O
Weicker O
and O
the O
real O
estate O
broker O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
showing O
that O
the O
contract O
was O
read O
to O
Hess O
at O
the O
broker\u2019s O
office O
and O
afterward O
to O
his O
wife. O
For O
this O
entire O
disregard O
of O
the O
rules O
the O
decree O
might O
well O
be O
affirmed O
, O
but O
the O
appellees O
have O
furnished O
an O
additional O
abstract O
in O
conformity O
with O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
court O
, O
and O
we O
prefer O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
merits O
and O
give O
the O
reasons O
requiring O
an O
affirmance O
. O
Fred O
Hess O
testified O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
the O
legal O
description O
of O
the O
lot; O
that O
he O
did O
not O
have O
his O
glasses O
at O
the O
broker\u2019s O
office O
and O
could O
not O
read O
the O
contract O
without O
them; O
that O
he O
did O
not O
try O
to O
read O
it O
, O
and O
that O
the O
broker O
in O
reading O
it O
did O
not O
read O
the O
exception. O
Martha O
H. O
Hess O
testified O
that O
she O
signed O
the O
contract O
without O
reading O
it O
when O
it O
was O
brought O
to O
her O
by O
the O
broker O
because O
her O
husband O
had O
signed O
it. O
The O
broker O
and O
Weicker O
testified O
that O
the O
contract O
was O
read O
in O
full O
at O
the O
broker\u2019s O
office O
, O
and O
the O
broker O
testified O
that O
he O
also O
read O
it O
to O
Mrs. O
Hess. O
Whether O
*274the O
contract O
was O
read O
was O
a O
controverted O
question O
, O
and O
if O
that O
fact O
were O
of O
any O
importance O
it O
is O
very O
likely O
that O
it O
was O
read O
, O
but O
no O
one O
wohld O
believe O
for O
a O
moment O
that O
either O
Hess O
or O
his O
wife O
signed O
the O
contract O
with O
knowledge O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
were O
being O
cheated O
and O
defrauded. O
In O
most O
cases O
if O
the O
intended O
victim O
of O
a O
fraud O
is O
suspicious O
of O
the O
party O
with O
whom O
he O
is O
dealing O
and O
exercises O
a O
high O
degree O
of O
care O
he O
will O
discover O
the O
fraud O
, O
but O
where O
there O
is O
an O
intentional O
and O
deliberate O
fraud O
, O
as O
there O
was O
in O
this O
case O
, O
it O
is O
not O
the O
privilege O
of O
the O
perpetrator O
of O
the O
fraud O
to O
interpose O
a O
defense O
that O
the O
one O
defrauded O
was O
not O
sufficiently O
careful O
to O
discover O
the O
fraud O
and O
prevent O
its O
accomplishment. O
In O
such O
a O
case O
one O
cannot O
impute O
negligence O
as O
against O
his O
own O
deliberate O
fraud O
and O
say O
that O
the O
party O
defrauded O
gave O
him O
too O
much O
credit O
for O
honesty. O

While O
the O
alleged O
defense O
is O
not O
available O
, O
the O
complainants O
were O
not O
guilty O
of O
negligence O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O
While O
there O
is O
no O
assignment O
of O

it O
is O

the O
decree O
was O
unfair O
because O
it O
did O
not O
set O
a O
time O
within O
which O
Hess O
was O
to O
tender O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
purchase O
price. O
The O
amount O
to O
.be O
paid O
was O
not O
fixed O
by O
the O
decree O
but O
included O
amounts O
paid O
by O
the O
defendants O
for O
taxes O
and O
installments O
of O
special O
assessments O
, O
deducting O
rents O
collected. O

for O

execution O
of O
a O
deed O

by O
the O

and O
the O

putting O
boards O
on O
a O
powder O
keg; O
that O
the O
keg O
fell O
over O
and O
he O
fell O
on O
his O
back O
, O
striking O
a O
piece O
of O
sulphur O
bar; O
that O
his O
back O
got O
weaker O
and O
pained O
him O
and O
pains O
shot O
down O
into O
his O
right O
leg; O
that O
the O
leg O
was O
weak O
and O
numb O
and O
he O
had O
lost O
forty O
per O
cent O
of O
the O
use O
of O
the O
leg. O
The O
ultimate O
fact O
to O
be O
determined O
by O
the O
arbitrator O
was O
what O
per O
cent O
, O
if O
any O
, O
of O
loss O
of O
the O
use O
of O
the O
leg O
had O
been O
ca\u00fased O
by O
the O
injury. O
That O
was O
to O
be O
determined O
by O
the O
arbitrator O
as O
a O
conclusion O
from O
the O
evidence O
tending O
to O
show O
the O
condition O
of O
Jaros O
and O
his O
ability O
to O
make O
use O
of O
the O
injured O
member O
as O
compared O
with O
such O
ability O
before O
the O
injury. O
The O
coal O
company O
objected O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
Jaros O
concerning O
the O
ultimate O
fact O
by O
which O
he O
substituted O
himself O
for O
the O
arbitrator O
, O
and O
the O
objection O
was O
overruled. O
There O
was O
testimony O
of O
two O
doctors O
and O
evidence O
tending O
to O
prove O
the O
effects O
of O
the O
injury O
, O
but O
the O
arbitrator O
appeared O
to O
have O
accepted O
the O
conclusion O
of O
Jaros O
, O
and O
made O
an O
award O
of O
$12 O
per O
week O
for O
nine O
weeks O
and O
four O
days O
for O
temporary O
total O
incapacity O
and O
$12 O
per O
week O
for O
seventy O
weeks O
upon O
a O
finding O
that O
the O
injury O
caused O
permanent O
partial O
loss O
of O
forty O
per O
cent O
of O
the O
use O
of O
the O
right O
leg. O
On O
a O
review O
by O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
the O
objection O
to O
the O
testimony O
which O
Jaros O
had O
given O
as O
to O
the O
percentage O
of O
loss O
was O
insisted O
upon O
, O
and O
there O
was O
some O
further O
evidence O
as O
to O
his O
condition. O
The O
Industrial O
Commission O
affirmed O
the O
award O
of O
the O
arbitrator O
, O
and O
on O
a O
writ O
of O
certiorari O
from O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Montgomery O
county O
the O
court O
on O
January O
10 O
, O
1921 O
, O
set O
aside O
the O
award O
as O
having O
been O
based O
on O
the O
testimony O
of O
Jaros O
as O
to O
the O
percentage O
of O
loss O
of O
the O
use O
of O
*611his O
right O
leg O
and O
referred O
the O
claim O
back O
to O
the O
Industri\u00e1l O
Commission O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
hearing O
further O
testimony O
by O
which O
to O
fix O
a O
proper O
basis O
for O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
amount O
of O
allowance O
to O
be O
made. O
There O
was O
another O
hearing O
before O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
, O
when O
the O
award O
of O
the O
arbitrator O
was O
again O
affirmed O
, O
and O
a O
writ O
of O
certiorari O
having O
been O
again O
issued O
out O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
, O
the O
writ O
was O
quashed O
and O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
affirmed. O
A O
writ O
of O
error O
was O
allowed O
by O
this O
court O
and O
the O
entire O
record O
is O
before O
us O
. O
No O
question O
of O
law O
is O
involved O
but O
only O
whether O
the O
injury O
is O
permanent O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
it. O
The O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
contends O
that O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
still O
rests O
upon O
the O
testimony O
of O
Jaros O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
forty O
per O
cent O
of O
the O
use O
of O
his O
leg; O
that O
there O
was O
no O
other O
evidence O
upon O
which O
the O
award O
could O
have O
been O
based O
, O
and O
that O
the O
evidence O
not O
only O
does O
not O
show O
that O
he O
sustained O
forty O
per O
cent O
permanent O
loss O
of O
the O
use O
of O
his O
leg O
but O
does O
not O
show O
that O
he O
sustained O
any O
permanent O
loss. O
When O
Jaros O
suffered O
his O
injury O
he O
was O
first O
treated O
by O
Dr. O
C. O
W. O
Vaughn O
, O
who O
did O
work O
for O
the O
company O
, O
and O
on O
May O
24 O
, O
1919 O
, O
he O
found O
a O
bruise O
and O
sprain O
of O
the O
small O
of O
the O
back O
and O
hips. O
He O
treated O
Jaros O
for O
about O
two O
weeks O
and O
testified O
that O
he O
was O
getting O
better O
, O
and O
Jaros O
was O
then O
referred O
by O
the O
company O
to O
Dr. O
J. O
J. O
Pleak O
, O
an O
osteopath. O
The O
osteopath O
testified O
that O
he O
first O
treated O
Jaros O
on O
June O
30 O
, O
1919 O
, O
and O
found O
an O
anterior O
rotation O
of O
the O
right O
in-nominate O
bone O
, O
which O
osteopaths O
term O
a O
partial O
dislocation; O
that O
the O
innominate O
bone O
joins O
the O
sacrum O
, O
and O
a O
dislocation O
of O
it O
might O
have O
an O
effect O
on O
the O
sciatic O
nerve O
down O
the O
leg O
and O
weaken O
it O
and O
prolong O
pain; O
that O
the O
dislocation O
would O
alter O
the O
relation O
between O
the O
innominate O
bone O
and O
the O
sacrum; O
that O
he O
reduced O
the O
dislocation O
on O
the O
\u00bb O
second O
treatment; O
that O
in O
this O
character O
of O
cases O
, O
if O
the O
patient O
will O
help O
, O
the O
osteopath O
can O
get O
a O
complete O
recovery; O
that O
Jaros O
returned O
to O
work O
but O
the O
doctor O
told O
him O
*612not O
to O
return; O
that O
Jaros O
went O
to O
work O
too O
soon O
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
believed O
that O
another O
week\u2019s O
treatment O
would O
have O
cured O
him O
. O
Jaros O
returned O
to O
work O
August O
6 O
, O
1919 O
, O
and O
worked O
steadily O
thereafter O
in O
his O
former O
employment O
as O
track-layer O
and O
timber-man. O
The O
last O
hearing O
was O
on O
February O
25 O
, O
1921 O
, O
and O
Jaros O
had O
worked O
regularly O
up O
to O
that O
time O
and O
received O
as O
much O
, O
or O
more O
, O
wages O
than O
before O
the O
injury. O
There O
had O
been O
a O
raise O
in O
wages O
, O
and O
he O
had O
earned O
$7.25 O
a O
day O
and O
worked O
more O
hours O
than O
the O
mine O
was O
in O
operation. O
He O
was O
paid O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
62% O
cents O
an O
hour O
for O
eight O
hours O
, O
and O
worked O
every O
day O
the O
mine O
worked O
and O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
extra O
time. O
He O
had O
his O
brother O
as O
a O
helper O
, O
and O
they O
handled O
heavy O
timbers O
, O
props O
and O
bars O
, O
and O
Jaros O
used O
a O
four-pound O
sledge O
in O
spiking O
rails. O
He O
testified O
that O
he O
could O
not O
stand O
hard O
work O
as O
he O
could O
before O
his O
injury O
, O
such O
as O
pushing O
or O
standing O
on O
the O
leg; O
that O
it O
got O
weak O
and O
trembled O
if O
he O
did O
work O
standing O
on O
it; O
that O
he O
sat O
down O
mostly O
when O
he O
spiked O
rails; O
that O
before O
he O
was O
hurt O
he O
could O
walk O
eight O
, O
ten O
or O
twelve O
miles O
without O
tiring; O
that O
he O
went O
out O
hunting O
recently O
and O
walked O
five O
miles O
and O
his O
leg O
got O
numb O
and O
he O
had O
to O
sit O
down; O
that O
he O
was O
a O
ball-player O
before O
the O
injury O
and O
could O
not O
get O
around O
now O
as O
he O
used O
to; O
that O
there O
had O
been O
no O
change O
in O
the O
condition O
of O
his O
leg O
since O
the O
injury O
, O
and O
that O
when O
he O
took O
light O
work O
and O
spiked O
rails O
he O
got O
along O
pretty O
well. O
The O
only O
time O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
from O
his O
work O
was O
the O
day O
when O
he O
went O
hunting O
. O
Weight O
is O
to O
be O
given O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
Dr. O
Vaughn O
and O
Dr. O
Pleak O
as O
to O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
back O
and O
leg O
when O
Jaros O
was O
treated O
in O
1919 O
, O
but O
there O
has O
been O
no O
medical O
examination O
or O
treatment O
since O
that O
time. O
There O
was O
no O
examination O
by O
any O
doctor O
to O
ascertain O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
leg O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
disability O
, O
which O
might O
have O
demonstrated O
a O
condition O
different O
from O
the O
testimony O
of O
Jaros O
, O
but O
the O
question O
was O
submitted O
upon O
his O
testimony O
and O
evi*613dence O
of O
what O
he O
had O
been O
doing O
and O
what O
he O
had O
earned. O
While O
he O
had O
been O
earning O
as O
much O
, O
or O
more O
, O
than O
before O
the O
injury O
, O
that O
fact O
is O
not O
conclusive O
that O
the O
injury O
had O
not O
resulted O
in O
permanent O
loss O
of O
some O
use O
of O
his O
leg. O
There O
cannot O
be O
much O
doubt O
that O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
was O
authorized O
to O
find O
the O
admitted O
injury O
to O
be O
permanent O
, O
and O
although O
there O
may O
be O
some O
reason O
to O
doubt O
whether O
the O
injury O
was O
as O
great O
in O
extent O
as O
the O
finding O
, O
we O
would O
not O
be O

Every O

that O

On O
petition O
for O
review O
there O
was O
no O
additional O
evidence O
before O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
, O
and O
the O
commission O
found O
on O
the O

that O
the O
applicant O
was O
temporarily O
totally O
incapacitated O
for O
work O
for O
a O
period O

63 O

, O

that O
as O
a O
further O
result O
of O
his O
injuries O
he O
was O
partially O
incapacitated O
for O
work O
for O
353 O

therefore O
awarded O
him O
compensation O
at O
the O
rate O

$12 O
a O

63 O
weeks O
, O
being O
the O
period O

further O
ordered O

determined O
that O

additional O

during O
a O

period O
of O
353 O

at O
a O
rate O

A O

. O
The O
award O
is O
signed O
by O
three O
commissioners O
, O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
contends O
that O
it O
appears O
from O
the O

that O
there O
were O
only O
three O

the O
board O
while O
the O
law O
required O
that O
the O
board O
should O
consist O

Section O
13 O
of O

Workmen\u2019s O
Compensation O
act O
provides O
for O
the O
creation O
of O
a O
board O

five O
members O
, O
and O
section O

provides O
that O
the O
decision O

a O
majority O
of O
the O
members O
shall O
be O
considered O
the O
decision O
of O
the O
commission. O
There O
is O
nothing O
to O
show O
that O
there O
were O
not O
five O
members O
of O
the O
board. O
It O
appears O
from O
the O
record O
that O
three O
members O
joined O
in O
the O
decision O
, O
and O
they O
being O
a O
majority O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
were O
authorized O
by O
the O
statute O
to O
act O
. O
The O
award O
cannot O
be O
sustained. O
It O
was O
rendered O
on O
September O
28 O
, O
1921 O
, O
63 O
weeks O
after O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
*502received O
his O
injury. O
It O
makes O
an O
award O
of O
$12 O
a O
week O
for O
63 O
weeks O
for O
temporary O
total O
incapacity O
and O
a O
further O
award O
of O
$6.50 O
a O
week O
for O
the O
further O
period O
of O
353 O
weeks O
for O
partial O
incapacity. O
The O
arbitrator O
found O
a O
temporary O
total O
incapacity O
for O
work O
and O
allowed O
compensation O
at O
the O
rate O
of O
half O
the O
claimant\u2019s O
earnings O
, O
continuing O
until O
the O
compensation O
equaled O
the O
amount O
which O
would O
have O
been O
payable' O
as O
a O
death O
benefit O
, O
and O
the O
commission O
on O
the O
same O
evidence O
found O
63 O
weeks O
of O
temporary O
total O
incapacity O
, O
for O
which O
it O
allowed O
compensation O
at O
$12 O
a O
week O
, O
and O
353 O
weeks O
of O
partial O
incapacity O
, O
which O
it O
must O
have O
regarded O
as O
temporary O
since O
the O
allowance O
made O
for O
it O
was O
to O
terminate O
at O
the O
expiration O
of O
a O
little O
less O
than O
seven O
years. O
There O
was O
as O
much O
evidence O
to O
support O
the O
one O
finding O
as O
the O
other O
and O
not O
enough O
to O
sustain O
either. O
The O
claimant O
testified O
that O
there O
was O
some O
kind O
, O
of O
work O
which O
he O
could O
do O
but O
he O
had O
not O
tried O
to O
find O
it. O
His O
incapacity O
on O
November O
15 O
, O
1920 O
, O
was O
therefore O
not O
total. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
from O
which O
a O
conclusion O
can O
be O
drawn O
as O
to O
whether O
the O
incapacity O
under O
which O
he O
labored O
was O
permanent O
or O
temporary O
, O
and O
if O
it O
was O
temporary O
, O
how O
long O
it O
would O
last. O
Neither O
the O
commission O
nor O
the O
courts O
are O
authorized O
to O
speculate O
as O
to O
the O
probable O
length O
of O
a O
period O
of O
total O
incapacity. O
That O
can O
only O
be O
determined O
when O
the O
period O
ends. O

of O

The O

there O
is O
no O

which O
his O

capacity O
can O
be O

The O
counsel O
for O
the O
defendant O
in O

say O
that O
the O
commission O
apparently O
took O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
had O
done O
light O
work O
, O
together O
with O
his O
testimony O
that O
there O
was O
some O
work O
he O
could O
do O
but O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
get O
any O
such O
work O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
his O
home O
at O
Spar O
land O
, O
as O
being O
sufficient O
to O
show O
he O
was O
able O
to O
earn O
some O
money O
and O
fixed O
the O
value O
of O
such O
services O
as O
he O
could O
render O
at O
$11 O
per O
week O
, O
making O
the O
difference O
between O
his O
weekly O
wages O

accident O
and O
the O
amount O
he O
was O
able O
to O
earn O
after O

accident O
$13 O

awarded O
compensation O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
fifty O

This O
is O

filed O
a O
bill O
in O

circuit O
court O

for O
a O
construction O
of O
the O
two O
wills O

dissatisfied O
with O
the O
construction O
given O
by O
the O
court O
, O
which O
was O
that O
the O
share O
of O
property O
appointed O
to O
Lee O
Berryhill O
goes O
to O
the O
heirs O
of O
Hannah O
S. O
Andrew O
, O
has O
appealed O
from O
the O
decree O
, O
claiming O
that O
the O
share O
so O
appointed O
should O
go O
to O
the O
heirs O
of O
Robert O
A. O
Andrew. O
This O
is O
the O
only O
question O
for O
our O
decision. O
It O
was O
the O
obvious O
intention O
of O
the O
testator O
to O
give O
to O
his O
wife O
the O
use O
of O
the O
whole O
of O
his O
property O
during O
her O
life O
and O
that O
the O
remainder O
after O
her O
death O
should O
be O
disposed O
of O
, O
one-half O
by O
him O
and O
one-half O
by O
her. O
He O
gave O
her O
as O
complete O
control O
of O
one-half O
the O
property O
as O
if O
she O
had O
been O
the O
owner O
in O
fee O
simple. O
She O
could O
exercise O
her O
general O
power O
of O
appointment O
at O
any O
time O
by O
a O
conveyance O
or O
appointment O
of O
the O
property O
, O
or O
any O
part O
of O
it O
, O
by O
deed O
to O
herself O
or O
anybody O
else O
, O
or O
at O
her O
death O
by O
will O
, O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
herself O
or-anybody O
else. O
If O
she O
failed O
to O
exercise O
*461the O
power O
as O
to O
the O
remainder O
or O
any O
part O
of O
it O
, O
the O
whole O
, O
or O
the O
part O
as O
to O
which O
the O
power O
of O
appointment O
was O
not O
exercised O
, O
not O
having O
been O
disposed O
of O
by O
the O
will O
of O
the O
testator O
, O
would O
descend O
to O
his O
heirs. O
The O
contention O
of O
the O
appellant O
is O
that O
so O
far O
as O
the O
one-eighth O
devised O
to O
Lee O
Berryhill O
is O
concerned O
the O
will O
was O
inoperative O
, O
because O
by O
his O
death O
in O
her O
lifetime O
the O
devise O
lapsed O
, O
and O
her O
will O
having O
made O
no O
provision O
for O
the O
disposition O
of O
a O
lapsed O
share O
, O
there O
was O
no O
appointment O
as O
to O
that O
one-eighth; O
that O
since O
her O
husband\u2019s O
will O
made O
no O
devise O
in O
default O
of O
appointment O
there O
was O
an O
intestacy O
as O
to O
that O
share O
and O
it O
descended O
to O
the O
heirs O
of O
the O
husband O
. O
It O
is O
argued O
in O
support O
of O
the O
decree O
that O
immediately O
upon O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
will O
of O
the O
testatrix O
the O
property O
was O
appointed O
and O
transferred O
by O
that O
act O
from O
the O
estate O
of O
Robert O
A. O
Andrew O
to O
the O
estate O
of O
Hannah O
S. O
Andrew O
, O
and O
that O
the O
lapsed O
share O
upon O
the O
death O
of O
Hannah O
being O
a O
part O
of O
her O
estate O
, O
descended O
to O
her O
heirs. O
We O
cannot O
assent O
to O
this O
proposition. O
Her O
will O
did O
not O
take O
effect O
in O
her O
lifetime. O
Until O
her O
death O
it O
was O
subject O
to O
revocation O
, O
and O
in O
that O
case O
would O
have O
been O
of O
no O
more O
effect O
than O
if O
it O
had O
never O
been O
written. O
The O
will O
must O
be O
construed O
as O
taking O
effect O
at O
the O
death O
of O
the O
testatrix O
, O
and O
it O
did O
not O
become O
effective O
as O
an O
execution O
of O
the O
power O
until O
that O
event. O
The O
real O
question O
for O
determination O
is O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
will O
as O
an O
appointment O
at O
the O
date O
of O
her O
death O
. O
The O
estate O
of O
the O
testatrix O
was O
only O
a O
life O
estate. O
The O
language O
of O
her O
husband\u2019s O
will O
so O
defined O
it O
, O
and O
the O
creation O
of O
the O
life O
estate O
prevents O
the O
power O
from O
enlarging O
the O
estate O
to O
a O
fee. O

to O

or O

Although O
there O
had O
been O
no O
execution O
of O
the O
power O
, O
a O
judgment O
creditor O
of O
the O
husband O
sought O
by O
bill O
in O
equity O
to O
subject O
the O
property O
to O
the O
payment O
of O
his O
judgment O
, O
but O
it O
was O
held O
that O
the O
husband O
took O
no O
interest O
, O
either O
legal O
or O
equitable O
, O
in O
the O
property O
by O
the O
will O
but O
was O
only O
the O
donee O
of O
a O
power O
to O
appoint O
in O
favor O
of O
himself O
or O
others. O
The O
court O
recognized O
the O
\u2022English O
doctrine O
that O
equity O
will O
not O
aid O
creditors O
where O
there O
has O
been O
no O
execution O
of O
the O
power O
, O
but O
will O
aid O
a O
defective O
execution O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
purchaser O
, O
creditor O
, O
wife O
or O
child O
, O
and O
will O
seize O
the O
fund O
and O
apply O
it O
to O
the O
debts O
of O
the O
donee O
of O
the O
power O
where O
a O
power O
has O
been O
executed O
in O
favor O
of O
a O
volunteer. O
It O
was O
said O
that O
\u201cno O
title O
or O
interest O
in O
the O
thing O
vests O
in O
the' O
donee O
of O
the O
power O
until O
he O
exercises O
the O
power. O
It O
is O
virtually O
an O
offer O
to O
him O
of O
the O
estate O
or O
fund O
that O
he O
may O
receive O
or O
reject O
at O
will O
, O
and O
, O
like O
any O
other O
offer O
to O
donate O
property O
to O
a O
person O
, O
no O
title O
can O
vest O
until O
he O
accepts O
the O
offer. O
Nor O
can O
a O
court O
of O
equity O
compel O
him O
to O
accept O
the O
property O
or O
fund O
against O
his O
will O
, O
even O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
creditors. O
If O
it O
should O
, O
it O
would O
be O
to O
convert O
the O
property O
of O
the O
person O
offering O
to O
make O
the O
donation O
to O
the O
payment O
of O
the O
debts O
of O
another O
person. O
Until O
accepted O
the O
person O
to O
whom O
the O
offer O
is O
made O
has O
not O
, O
nor O
can O
he O
have O
, O
the O
slightest O
interest O
or O
title O
to O
the O
property. O
So O
the O
donee O
of O
the O
power O
only O
receives O
the O
naked O
power O
to O
make O
the O
property O
or O
fund O
his O
own O
, O
and O
when O
he O
exercises O
the O
power O
he O
thereby O
consents O
to O
receive O
it O
and O
the O
title O
thereby O
vests O
in O
him O
, O
although O
it O
may O
pass O
out O
of O
him O
eo O
inst-anti O
to O
the O
appointee; O
and O
when O
the O
appointee O
is O
a O
volunteer O
, O
the O
court O
holds O
that O
he O
by O
the O
appointment O
endeavors O
to O
misapply O
his O
.property O
to O
defraud O
his O
creditors; O
that O
he O
must O
be O
just O
before O
he O
is O
generous. O
This O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
reason O
upon O
which O
the O
cases O
proceed.\u201d O

The O
object O
of O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
will O
is O
to O
give O
effect O
to O
the O
intention O
which O
the O
testator O
has O
expressed O
by O
the O
words O
he O
has O
used O
, O
considered O
in O
the O
light O
of O
the O
surrounding O
circumstances. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
testatrix O
was O
legally O
the O
owner O
of O
property O
of O
any O
great O
value. O
She O
had O
the O
control O
, O
as O
completely O
as O
if O
she O
owned O
them O
, O
of O
lands O
, O
personal O
property O
and O
the O
home O
in O
which O
she O
lived O
, O
of O
considerable O
value. O
Doubtless O
she O
regarded O
herself O
as O
the O
owner O
of O
one-half O
of O
all O
the O
property O
in O
her O
possession. O
It O
was O
to O
this O
property O
which O
she O
referred O
in O
the O
third O
clause O
of O
her O
will O

whereby O
she O
devised O
"all O

rest O

estate O

real O
and O
personal.\u201d O
So O
far O
as O
the O
evidence O
discloses O
, O
this O
was O
all O
the O
estate O
she O
had. O
To O
make O
clear O
what O
she O
included O
in O
the O
term O
\u201cmy O

, O
\u201d O
she O
stated O
that O
by O
this O
clause O

she O
intended O
to O
comprise O

to O
the O
property O

she O

in O
her O
own O

all O

a O
life O

, O
which O
, O
of O
course O
, O
she O

not O

it O
perfectly O

her O

comprised O

1913 O
, O
owned O
in O
fee O
simple O
the O
undivided O
one-fourth O
of O
350 O
acres O
of O
farm O
land O
in O
Logan O
county. O
The O
other O
three-fourths O
were O
owned O
by O
Boren\u2019s O
brother O
and O
two O
sisters. O
On O
the O
first O
day O
of O
Octo'ber O
, O
1913 O
, O
Boren O
conveyed O
by O
a O
deed O
of O
trust O
to O
his O

, O
Hannah O
E. O
Burton O
, O
his O
undivided O

interest O
in O
the O

, O
subject O
to O
the O
conditions O
specified O
that O
the O
trustee O
*441should O
pay O
the O
grantor O
all O
the O
net O
income O
received O
from O
the O
land. O
The O
trust O
deed O
gave O
the O
trustee O
or O
her O
successor O
power O
to O
lease O
or O
sell O
the O
property O
and O
convey O
the O
same O
by O
proper O
deed O
and O
re-invest O
the O
funds O
in O
other O
income-producing O
real O
estate O
or O
loans O
and O
pay O
the O
net O
income O
to O
the O
grantor. O
The O
deed O
provided O
that O
the O
trust O
created O
by O
it O
should O
continue O
in O
force O
during O
the O
life O
of O
the O
grantor O
and O
should O
terminate O
at O
his O
death. O
Power O
was O
given O
the O
trustee O
to O
appoint O
a O
successor O
in O
trust O
, O
and O
in O
case O
she O
did O
not O
exercise O
the O
power O
a O
successor O
was O
to O
be O
appointed O
by O
a O
court O
having O
jurisdiction O
to O
do O
so. O
The O
fourth O
provision O
of O
the O
trust O
deed O
is O
as O
follows: O
\u201cUpon O
the O
death O
of O
the O
said O
Edward O
B. O
Boren O
, O
cestui O
que O

created O
shall O
cease O
and O

, O
and O
when O
said O

is O
terminated O
the O
trust O
property O
, O
as O
the O

of O
the O
said O
Edward O
B. O
Boren O
, O
whether O

Edward O
B. O
Boren O
, O

be O

to O
said O
property O
under O
the O
laws O
of O

of O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
then O
in O
force.\u201d O
The O
trustee O
named O
in O
the O
deed O
accepted O
the O
trust O
and O
acted O
as O
trustee O
until O
January O
, O
1922 O
, O
when O
she O
filed O
the O
bill O
in O
this O
case O
for O
an O
accounting O
, O
tendering O
her O
resignation O
as O
trustee O
, O
asking O
that O
her O
report O
as O
such O
trustee O
be O
approved O
and O
that O
she O
be O
discharged O
and O
her O
successor O
appointed. O
Boren O
answered O
the O
bill O
, O
admitting O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
account O
of O
the O
trustee O
, O
consenting O
to O
her O
resignation O
, O
and O
alleging O
that O
the O
reversion O
in O
fee O
to O
the O
undivided O
one-fourth O
of O
the O
land O
conveyed O
to O
the O
trustee O
is O
in O
him; O
that O
the O
only O
interest O
conveyed O
by O
the O
trust O
deed O
was O
an O
estate O
during O
his O
life O
, O
and O
that O
no O
person O
other O
than O
the O
trustee O
and O
himself O
has O
any O
interest O
in O
the O
trust O
property. O
The O
answer O
avers O
the O
trustee O
has O
never O
exercised O
the O
power O
to O
appoint O
her O
successor O
and O
that O
he O
is O
competent O
and O
able O
to O
efficiently O
manage O
the O
property. O
Boren O
also O
filed O
a O
cross-bill O
, O
in O
which O
he O
alleged O
that O
the O
*442only O
title O
conveyed O
by O
him O
by O
the O
trust O
deed O
to O
Hannah O
E. O
Burton O
was O
an O
estate O
for O
and O
during O
the O
life O
of O
the O
grantor; O
that O
he O
is O
the O
owner O
of O
the O
reversion O
in O
fee O
, O
and O
no O
other O
person O
except O
himself O
and O
the O
trustee O
has O
any O
right O
, O
title O
or O
interest O
in O
the O
trust O
property. O
The O
cross-bill O
admits O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
trustee\u2019s O
account O
filed O
, O
consents O
to O
her O
resignation O
, O
and O
prays O
the O
trust O
be O
decreed O
terminated O
and O
the O
trustee O
required O
to O
convey O
the O
property O
to O
cross-complainant O
and O
deliver O
to O
him O
all O
property O
shown O
by O
her O
report O
and O
statement O

to O
him. O
Boren O
had O
two O
children O
, O
and O
both O
were O

when O
these O
proceedings O
were O

They O
were O

Marie O
Richards O
and O
Irene O
Hagedorn O
, O
and O
were O
made O
defendants O
to O
the O
cross-bill. O
They O
disclaimed O
any O
interest O
in O
the O
subject O
matter O
of O
the O
litigation O
, O
and O
Hannah O
E. O
Burton O
, O
the O

, O
demurred O
to O
the O
cross-bill. O
The O
court O
overruled O
the O

and O
she O
elected O
to O
abide O
by O
the O
demurrer. O
A O
decree O

In O
the O
Akers O

it O
was O
held O
that O
where O
a O

conveys O
a O

The O

will O
be O
regarded O
as O
defining O
or O
limiting O
the O
estate O
which O
the O

has. O
In O
such O
case O
the O

The O

disclaimed O

it O
is O
clear O
from O

they O

No O

persons O
being O

in O
the O

except O

, O
the O
question O
for O
decision O
appears O
to O
be O
narrowed O
to O
whether O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
terminating O
the O

This O

held O
that O
where O

no O

From O

been O

to O

court O
by O
writ O
of O

for O
further O
review O
. O
From O
the O
record O
before O
us O
it O
appears O
that O
the O
parties O
to O
this O
litigation O
were O
under O
and O
subject O
to O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
Workmen\u2019s O
Compensation O
act; O
that O
the O
accident O
toPerchules O
arose O
out O
of O
and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
the O
employment; O
that O
the O
notice O
as O
to O
the. O
cause O
of O
the O
accident O
was O
made O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
act; O
that O
medical O
and O
surgical O
aid O
had O
been O
furnished O
to O
Perchules O
by O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
been O
paid O
$158 O
on O
his O
compensation O
by O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
The O
record O
shows O
that O
he O
had O
two O
chil-dren O
under O
the O
age O
of O
sixteen. O
\u25a0 O
He O
was O
working O
as O
a O
timberman O
in O
plaintiff O
in O
error\u2019s O
mine O
and O
sustained O
the O
injury O
November O
4 O
, O
1920 O
, O
caused O
, O
according O
to O
his O
testimony O
, O
by. O
the O
falling O
of O
a O
large O
amount O
of O
slate O
from O
the O
roof O
of-the O
mine O
, O
some O
of O
which O
struck O
him O
on O
the O
left O
arm O
, O
and O
he O
fell O
and O
struck O
his O
elbow O
on O
a O
car O
or O
some O
other O
object O
, O
injuring O
his O
arm O
severely. O
The O
evidence O
shows O
that O
he O
went O
home O
the O
day O
of O
the O
accident O
after O
telling O
his O
immediate O
boss O
that O
he O
could O
not O
work O
, O
and O
went O
to O
see O
Dr. O
Ot-. O
*135ten O
, O
who O
treated O
him O
for O
two O
days O
, O
and O
l\u00e1ter O
, O
after O
consulting O
with O
Dr. O
Emil O
L. O
Bernard O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
where O
he O
remained O
three O
months O
or O
more O
, O
having O
his O
arm O
dressed O
and O
receiving O
treatment. O
It O
appears O
that O
he O
went O
back O
to O
his O
work O
in O
the O
mine O
two O
or O
three O
different O
times O
before O
he O
found O
he O
could O
not O
keep O
on O
working O
as O
he O
could O
not O
lift O
his O
arm O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
not O
worked O
in O
the O
mine O
since O
that O
time. O
The O
award O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
was O
that O
Perchules O
was O
temporarily O
totally O
incapacitated O
for O
twenty-six O
weeks O
and O
sustained O
a O
permanent O
five O
per O
\u25a0 O
cent O
loss O
of O
use O
of O
his O
left O
arm O
, O
and O
granted O
compensation O
accordingly. O
The O
only O
questions O
in O
dispute O
in O
the O
case O
are O
the O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
the O
injury O
, O
and O
whether O
the O
compensation O
allowed O
is O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
evidence O
and O
the O
statute O
. O
On O
the O
hearings O
before O
the O
arbitrator O
and O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
Perchules O
testified O
that O
after O
the O
accident O
he O
could O
only O
lift O
about O
20 O
pounds O
, O
whereas O
he O
could O
easily O
lift O
150 O
pounds O
before. O
Dr.-Bernard O
, O
who O
treated O
him O
for O
some O
seven O
months O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
testified O
, O
on O
review O
, O
that O
he O
examined O
the O
injured O
man O
on O
November O
6 O
and O
found O
him O
very O
sick O
, O
there O
being O
a O
wound O
on O
the O
left O
arm O
that O
had O
become O
infected O
and O
was O
swollen O
from O
the O
joint O
.to O
the O
elbow; O
that O
he O
advised O
the O
patient O
to O
go O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
later O
opened O
up O
the O
arm; O
that O
Perchules O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
about O
four O
months O
under O
his O
care O
and O
witness O
saw O
him O
a O
number O
of O
times O
each O
week; O
that O
when O
the O
patient O
left O
the O
hospital O
he O
still O
complained O
of O
soreness O
and O
weakness O
of O
the O
arm O
and O
that O
he O
was O
still O
somewhat O
weak O
from O
the O
infection O
in O
his O
system O
, O
and O
that O
as O
late O
as O
May O
3 O
he O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
do O
hard O
manual O
labor; O
that O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
witness O
it O
would O
take O
six O
or O
eight O
weeks O
more O
to O
build O
Perchules O
up O
so O
he O
could O
do O
normal O
work. O
This O
doctor O
also O
testified O
that O
a O
month O
before O
the O
hearing O
, O
on O
review O
before O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
, O
he O
examined O
the O
wound O
in O
the O
arm O
and O
found O
it O
healed O
, O
and O
the O
motion O
in O
*136the O
arm O
was O
good O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
that O
he O
did O
not O
have O
entire O
flexion O
in O
that O
arm O
, O
and O
that O
there O
was O
at O
least O
fifteen O
per O
cent O
loss O
of O
flexion O
, O
which O
he O
considered O
was O
demonstrated O
at O
the O
hearing O
by O
his O
having O
the O
injured O
man O
put O
his O
arms O
up O
in O
different O
ways O
and O
trying O
to O
touch O
his O
shoulders; O
that O
he O
thought O
he O
still O
had O
some O
adhesions O
in O
the O
elbow O
and O
that O
the O
arm O
was O
in O
as O
good O
shape O
as O
it O
ever O
would O
be; O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
flexion O
in O
the O
arm O
would O
not O
disable O
him O
from O
using O
the O
arm O
as O
well O
as O
he O
did O
before O
the O
accident O
, O
in O
ordinary O
work O
. O
Dr. O
Charles O
L. O
Patton O
, O
the O
doctor O
for O
the O
mining O
company O
, O
testified O
both O
before O
the O
arbitrator O
and O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
that O
he O
had O
examined O
the O
applicant O
on O
May O
2 O
and O
17 O
and O
September O
6 O
and O
October O
3 O
following O
the O
accident O
, O
and O
that O
from O
his O
examination O
in O
his O
opinion O
the O
applicant O
was O
able O
to O
work. O
He O
also O
had O
taken O
X-ray O
pictures O
of O
the O
arm. O
The O
doctor O
also O
testified O
to O
various O
motions O
that O
he O
had O
the O
injured O
man O
make O
in O
order O
to O
test O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
accident; O
that O
he O
could O
find O
no O
evidence O
of O
any O
nerve O
injury O
or O
to O
the O
joints O
, O
and O
, O
so O
far O
as O
he O
could O
ascertain O
, O
the O
elbow O
and O
shoulder O
joints O
could O
be O
put O
through O
all O
the O
range O
of O
motion O
that O
the O
normal O
joint O
could O
be O
put O
through; O
that O
Perchules O
had O
voluntary O
flexion O
and O
extension O
of O
the O
elbow O
joint O
that O
was O
normal; O
that O
witness O
found O
. O
a O
scar O
about O
an O
inch O
and O
a O
half O
long O
over O
the O
point O
of O
the O
elbow O
but O
could O
find O
no O
atrophy O
of O
the O
muscles; O
that O
he O
could O
find O
nothing O
to O
indicate O
a O
loss O
of O
the O
use O
of O
the O
arm; O
that O
twice O
when O
the O
injured O
man O
visited O
him O
for O
examination O
witness O
found O
him O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
liquor O
, O
and O
that O
in O
his O
judgment O
he O
had O
fully O
recovered O
from O
his O
disability O
on O
account O
of O
his O
injury O
, O
and O
that O
the O
arm O
, O
when O
witness O
last O
examined O
him O
, O
was O
normal O
. O
Dr. O
R. O
F. O
Herndon O
testified O
that O
it O
was O
his O
opinion O
, O
from O
his O
examination O
in O
March O
and O
again O
twice O
in O
May O
, O
that O
the O
injured O
man O
could O
have O
returned O
to O
work O
in O
March O
. O
*137It O
is O
plain O
that O
there O
is O
a O
conflict O
between O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
various O
doctors. O
Perchules\u2019 O
testimony O
as O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
his O
injury O
afforded O
some O
basis O
for O
determining O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
injury O
, O
and O
the O
personal O
examination O
made O
by O
the O
members O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
also O
afforded O
some O
basis O
for O
such O
determination. O
(Central O

It O
is O
true O
that O
under O
the O
decisions O
of O
this O
court O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
period O
of O
temporary O

is O
the O
period O
of O

is O

The O
testimony O
of O
Dr. O
Bernard O
, O
who O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
the O
injured O
man\u2019s O
case O
from O
a O
day O
or O
two O
after O
the O
accident O
until O
he O
left O
the O
hospital O
, O
was O
that O
Perchules O
was O
temporarily O
totally O
incapacitated O
for O
a O
period O
of O
twenty-six O
weeks. O
It O
would O
appear O
from O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
whole O
time O
the O
applicant O
was O
treated O
for O
the O
injury O
was O
from O
November O
4 O
, O
1920 O
, O
to O
May O
3 O
, O
1921 O
, O
but O
it O
would O
also O
appear O
that O
during O
that O
time O
he O
actually O
worked O
a O
number O
of O
days O
, O
for O
which O
he O
received O
compensation. O
It O
cannot O
be O
held O
that O
he O
was O
totally O
incapacitated O
during O
those O
days O
, O
and O
this O
time O
should O
at O
least O
be O
taken O
from O
the O
period O
of O
temporary O

incapacity. O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
one O
sore O
had O
healed O
at O
the O
time O
the O
applicant O
left O
the O
hospital. O
Nevertheless O
he O
continued O
to O
receive O
treatments O
, O
and O
as O
his O
doctor O
testified O
, O
it O
was O
not O
until O
May O
3 O
he O
ceased O
the O
treatments O
, O
and O
the O
doctor O
did O
not O
consider O
him O
even O
then O
in O
a O
proper O
condition O
for O
work. O
We O
think O
this O
evidence O
was O
proper O
as O
to O
the O
period O
of O
temporary O
total O
disability O
. O
Counsel O
for O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
argues O
that O
the O
period O
of O
temporary O
total O
disability O
terminated O
upon O
the O
applicant\u2019s O
first O
return O
to O
work O
the O
first O
part O
of O
February O
, O
and O
states O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
testimony O
submitted O
of O
any O
change O
in O
the O
condition O
of O
his O
arm O
since O
that O
time. O
It O
is O
true O
there O
*138is O
nothing O
in O
the O
doctor\u2019s O
testimony O
that O
refers O
to O
treatments O
when O
the O
applicant O
was O
actually O
working O
before O
his. O
treatments O
ceased O
, O
but O
he O
does O
testify O
to O
the O
general O
weakness O
and O
systemic O
infection O
resulting O
from O
the O
injury O
to O
the O
arm O
, O
and O
his O
belief O
that O
the O
applicant O
should O
take O
from O
six O
to O
eight O
weeks O
following O
his O
last O
examination O
on O
May O
3 O
, O
1921 O
, O
to O
build O
himself O
up O
in O
preparation O
for O
his O
occupational O
work O
, O
and O
that O
at O
that O
date O
he O
was O
too O
weak O
to O
do O
hard O
manual O
labor. O
It O
is O
not O
shown O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
doctor O
knew O
of O
the O
applicant\u2019s O
attempts O
to O
work O
, O
but O
he O
does O
assume O
to O
know O
the O
applicant\u2019s O
condition O
at O
the O
times O
of O
his O
examinations. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
applicant O
attempted O
to O
perform O
labor O
at O
the O
mine O
and O
failed O
should O
not O
stand O
as O
a O
bar O
to O
prevent O
his O
receiving O
compensation O
for O
the O
time O
he O
was O
incapacitated O
, O
and O
we O
think O
the O
time O
for O
the O
building-up O
process O
, O
which O
the O
commission O
evidently O
fixed O
at O
about O
the O
same O
length O
of O
time O
as O
the O
time O
he O
attempted O
to O
work O
, O
was O
properly O
included O
as O
a O
part O
of O
the O
period O
of O
temporary O
total O
incapacity. O
We O
think O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
time O
determined O
by O
the O
Industrial O
Commission\u2019s O
decision O
finds O
support O
in O
the O
testimony O
, O
\u2014 O
that O
is O
, O
the O
time O
of O
treatment O
from O
November O
4 O
, O
1920 O
, O
to O
May O
3 O
, O
1921 O
, O
deducting O
the O
time O
he. O
worked O
and O
received O
compensation O
and O
adding O
the O
time O
for O
the O
building-up O
process O
immediately O
following O
May O
3 O
. O
It O
is O
also O
contended O
by O
counsel O
for O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
that O
the O
award O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
was O
not O
justified O
as O
to O
the O
allowance O
of O
ten O
weeks\u2019 O
compensation O
at O
$13 O
per O
week O
for O
a O
permanent O
five O
per O
cent O
loss O
of O
use O
of O
the O
left O
arm. O
We O
have O
given O
the O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
consideration O
, O
and O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
applicant O
, O
together O
with O
that O
of O
all O
the O
doctors O
who O
examined O
him O
, O
considered O
by O
the O
commissioners O
in O
connection O
with O
their O
examination O
as O
to O
the O
injury O
, O
justified O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
commission O
as O
to O
the O
award. O
We O
do O
not O
think O
that O
the O
evidence O
found O
in O
the O
record O
is O
such O
as O
to O
justify O
this O

Answer O

The O
Appellate O
Court O
made O
a O
finding O
of O
facts O
as O
follows: O
\u201cThe O
court O
finds O
that O
the O
contract O
under O
which O
appellee O
rendered O
the O
services O
sued O
for O
was O
a O
contract O
by O
which O
appellant O
agreed O
to O
pay O
appellee O
and O
W. O
C. O
Connett O
$500 O
for O
their O
services O
in O
a O
certain O
foreclosure O
suit O
, O
but O
if O
the O
court O
should O
allow O
any O
additional O
amount O
for O
attorneys\u2019 O
fees O
as O
costs O
and O
appellant O
collected O
it O
, O
then O
said O
Connett O
and O
appellee O
should O
have O
the O
amount O
so O
collected. O
No O
such O
fee O
was O
allowed O
or O
collected.\u201d O
The O
undisputed O
facts O
are O
, O
that O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
brought O
suit O
in O
the O
city O
court O
of O
East O
St. O
Louis O
for O
the O
foreclosure O
of O
a O
mortgage O
and O
obtained O
a O
decree O
, O
which O
was O
reversed O
by O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
for O
the O
Fourth O
District O
for O
the O
reason O
that O
a O
solicitor\u2019s O
fee O
for O
$3000 O
had O
been O
included O
in O
the O
decree O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
complainant\u2019s O
solicitor O
, O
who O
was O
one O
of O
complainant\u2019s O
directors O
, O
and O
no O
resolution O
of O
the O
corporation O
to O
pay O
for O
his O
services O
had O
been O
adopted. O
Thereupon O
the O
bank O
decided O
that O
its O
former O
attorney O
should O
have O
no O
more O
to O
do O
with O
the O
case O
, O
and O
through O
August O
Schlafly O
, O
its O
president O
, O
employed O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
to*178gether O
with O
W. O
C. O
Connett O
, O
who O
had O
recently O
been O
appointed O
general O
counsel O
of O
the O
bank O
, O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
and O
conduct O
the O
case O
for O
a O
fee O
of O
$500 O
and O
any O
additional O
amount O
which O
the O
court O
might O
allow O
and O
the O
bank O
should O
collect. O
The O
cause O
was O
re-instated O
in O
the O
city O
court O
, O
evidence O
was O
taken O
before O
the O
master O
, O
a O
motion O
was O
made O
by O
one O
of O
the O
defendants O
for O
leave O
to O
amend O
the O
answer O
to O
set O
up O
the O
defense O
of O
usury O
, O
which O
was O
denied O
by O
the O
court O
, O
and O
the O
cause O
proceeded O
to O
a O
decree O
for O
the O
full O
amount O
of O
the O
complainant\u2019s O
claim O
, O
but O
no O
effort O
was O
made O
to O
have O
a O
solicitor\u2019s O
fee O
taxed O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
complainant. O
There O
was O
an O
appeal O
to O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
, O
which O
affirmed O
the O
decree O
, O
and O
a O
petition O
for O
a O
writ O
of O
certiorari O
was O
denied. O
The O
litigation O
being O
ended O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
presented O
a O
bill O
to O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
for O
$2500 O
solicitor\u2019s O
fees O
and O
$10 O
costs O
advanced O
in O
the O
Appellate O
Court. O
The O
defendant O
in O
error O
refused O
to O
pay O
it O
, O
insisting O
that O
it O
was O
liable O
only O
for O
the O
$500 O
agreed O
to O
be O
paid O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
and O
Connett O
, O
since O
no O
additional O
amount O
had O
been O
allowed O
by O
the O
court O
or O
collected O
by O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
. O
It O
is O
claimed O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
that O
after O
the O
taking O
of O
evidence O
before O
the O
master O
the O
defendant O
introduced O
a O
contract O
under- O
which O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
had O
become O
the O
purchaser O
of O
the O
$50 O

note O
, O
secured O
by O
the O
mortgage O
, O
for O
$30 O
, O
000 O
, O
and O
had O
agreed O
to O
accept O
in O
payment O
$35 O
, O
000 O
if O
paid O
within O
a O
certain O
fixed O
time O

if O
not O
paid O
until O
a O
certain O
stated O
time O
, O
would O
require O
payment O
in O

It O
was O
claimed O
that O
in O

of O
thi\u00a7 O
contract O
the O

The O

in O
error O
testified O
that O
he O
sent O
for O
Paul O
Schlafly O
, O
who O
was O
the O
vice-president O
of O
the O
bank O
and O
the O
son O
of O
August O
Schlafly O
, O
the O
president O
, O
and O
told O
him O
that O
the O
case O
had O
been O
to O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
once O
and O
was O
go*179ing O
again O
, O
\u2014 O
that O
the O
defendants O
would O
take O
it O
up; O
that O
when O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
went O
into O
the O
case O
the O
bank O
said O
it O
would O
pay O
him O
and O
Connett O
a O
$500 O
fee O
, O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
had O
assumed O
that O
Connett O
was O
chief O
counsel O
and O
would O
do O
the O
work O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
would O
sort O
of O
trail O
around O
with O
him O
and O
advise O
him O
, O
but O
had O
no O
idea O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
be O
called O
upon O
to O
do O
all O
the O
work O
and O
assume O
all O
the O
responsibility O
in O
the O
case. O
He O
told O
Schlafly O
that O
he O
was O
not O
going O
to O
assume O
all O
the O
responsibility O
and O
do O
all O
the O
work O
even O
if O
he O
got O
the O
whole O
$500; O
that O
he O
thought O
it O
was O
dangerous O
to O
ask O
the O
court O
to O
allow O
a O
solicitor\u2019s O
fee; O
that O
the O
court O
had O
previously O
allowed O
a O
solicitor\u2019s O
fee O
of O
$3500 O
and O
the O
decree O
was O
reversed O
because O
the O
solicitor O
was O
a O
director O
of O
the O
bank O
, O
and O
as O
far O
as O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
knew O
he O
was O
still O
a O
director O
, O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
was O
his O
partner O
, O
and O
was O
doubtful O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
, O
under O
these O
conditions O
, O
would O
sustain O
a O
fee O
allowed O
in O
this O
foreclosure O
suit O
under O
the O
amended O
bill. O
He O
said O
he O
was O
not O
disturbed O
about O
getting O
a O
decree O
for O
the O
$50 O
, O
000 O
in O
the O
state O
of O
the O
pleadings O
, O
but O
he O
thought O
that O
if O
a O
solicitor\u2019s O
fee O
were O
allowed O
there O
might O
be O
danger O
that O
the O
decree O
would O
be O
reversed O
and O
the O
cause O
sent O
back O
, O
and O
an O
amendment O
might O
be O
made O
to O
the O
answer. O
The O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
testified O
that O
he O
said O
to O
Paul O
Schlafly O
that O
\u201cif O
there O
is O
a O
reversal O
in O
this O
case O
they O
will O
ask O
to O
file O
amended O
pleadings. O
I O
am O
willing O
to O
go O
ahead O
on O
this O
case O
on O
one O
condition O
, O
and O
that O
is O
, O
if O
the O
bank O
would O
pay O
me O
a O
reasonable O
fee O
for O
the O
services O
I O
render. O
Mr. O
Connett O
isn\u2019t O
doing O
anything O
, O
and O
I O
will O
withdraw O
from O
the O
case O
before O
I O
will O
go O
ahead.\u201d O
He O
testified O
that O
Schlafly O
said O
that O
that O
was O
all O
right; O
that O
whatever O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
was O
worth O
the O
bank O
would O
pay O
, O
and- O
he O
should O
go O
ahead O
. O
Paul O
Schlafly O
testified O
that O
at O
the O
time O
in O
question O
he O
was O
the O
vice-president O
of O
defendant O
in O
error; O
that O
he O
had O
no O
connection O
with O
the O
employment O
of O
Connett O
and O
Hadley O
in O
the O
foreclosure O
suit O
after O
the O
first O
appeal; O
that O
dur*180ing O
the O
pendency O
o.f O
the O
suit O
he O
was O
asked O
by O
his O
father O
, O
who O
\\Vas O
the O
president O
, O
to O
see O
Judge O
Hadley O
and O
see O
what O
progress O
had O
been O
made O
, O
and O
he O
did O
call O
on O
him O
to O
ask O
him O
about O
the O
case O
and O
he O
reported O
to O
his O
father O
such O
reports O
as O
Hadley O
made O
to O
'him; O
that O
he O
did O
not O
have O
the O
conversation O
with O
Hadley O
with O
reference O
to O
fees O
which O
the O
latter O
testified O
to O
, O
and O
that O
Hadley O
at O
no O
time O
said O
to O
him O
that O
he O
wanted O
any O
different O
arrangement O
with O
the O
bank O
from O
the O
original O
arrangement O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
fee; O
that O
Hadley O
did O
not O
tell O
him O
under O
the O
circumstances O
it O
was O
not O
proper O
for O
Hadley O
to O
prove O
up O
solicitor\u2019s O
fees O
in O
the O
foreclosure O
suit O
, O
and O
that O
he O
never O
talked O
to O
Hadley O
about O
the O
matter O
of O
lawyer\u2019s O
fees O
but O
first O
learned O
of O
the O
latter\u2019s O
claim O
when O
he O
presented O
a O
bill O
and O
asked O
that O
his O
account O
be O
credited. O
This O
was O
the O
contested O
question O
in O
the O
case O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
found O
it O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
defendant O
, O
and O
we O
are O
bound O
by O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
. O
It O
is O
argued O
that O
the O
finding O
of O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
results O
from O
erroneous O
conclusions O
of O
law O
reached O
by O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
as O
shown O
by O
its O
opinion: O
First O
, O
that O
the O
vice-president O
of O
the O
bank O
, O
Paul O
Schlafly O
, O
had O
no O
authority O
to O
make O
a O
contract O
for O
the O
bank O
for O
the O
payment O
of O
attorney O
fees; O
second O
, O
that O
the O
contract O
of O
employment O
between O
attorney O
and O
client O
is O
such O
that O
it O
cannot O
thereafter O
be O
changed O
during O
the O
pendency O
of O
the O
litigation. O
These O
two O
propositions O
are O
argued O
in O
the O
briefs O
of O
counsel O
for O
the O
respective O
parties O
but O
they O
are O
not O
presented O
for O
our O
consideration O
on O
this O
record. O
They O
are O
discussed O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
, O
but O
only O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
question O
of O
fact O
whether O
a O
contract O
in O
relation O
to O
attorney O
fees O
subsequent O
to O
the O
original O
contract O
was O
made O
by. O
the O
defendant O
in O
error. O
This O
question O
of O
fact O
is O
fully O
argued O
on O
each O
side O
as O
if O
it O
were O
open O
to O
consideration O
in O
this O
court. O
The O
opinion O
of O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
is O
a O
part O
of O
the O
files O
of O
the O
case O
, O
and O
while O
error O
cannot O
be O
assigned O
*181upon O
it O
, O
it O
may O
be O
examined O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
court O
predicated O
its O
judgment O
solely O
upon O
an O
erroneous O
conception O
of O
the O
law. O
(Foster O
v. O
Graf O
, O
287 O
Ill. O
559.) O
'The O
Appellate O
Court O
has O
power O
, O
in O
reviewing O
judgments O
of O
trial O
courts O
, O
to O
determine O
the O
facts O
from O
its O
own O
consideration O
of O
the O
evidence O
and O
render O
judgment O
accordingly. O
If O
it O
reverses O
a O
judgment O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
different O
finding O
of O
facts O
from O
that O
of O
the O
trial O
court O
its O
judgment O
must O
recite O
the O
ultimate O
facts O
found O
, O
and O
such O
recital O
is O
conclusive O
upon O
this O
court. O
The O
only O
question O
open O
for O
review O
in O
such O
case O
is O
whether O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
erred O
in O
its O
application O
of O
the O
law O
to O
the O
facts. O
The O
ultimate O
question O
of O
fact O
in O
this O
case O
, O
and O
the O
only O
question O
in O
dispute O
, O
was O
whether O
the O
services O
were O
rendered O
under O
the O
original O
contract O
or O
a O
subsequent O
contract O
, O
\u2014 O
that O
is O
, O
whether O
any O
subsequent O
contract O
was O
made. O
The O
decision O
of O
this O
question O
involved O
a O
consideration O
of O
the O
contradictory O
testimony O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
and O
Paul O
Schlafly O
as O
to O
the O
conversation O
by O
which O
the.plaintiff O
in O
error O
claims O
the O
new O
contract O
was O
made O
, O
and O
the O
sufficiency O
of O
the O
evidence O
to O
establish O
Schlafly\u2019s O
authority O
to O
make O
the O
alleged O
subsequent O
contract O
or O
to O
establish O
the O
estoppel O
alleged O
by O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
against O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
to O
deny O
such O
authority O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
legal O
questions O
of O

authority O
, O
if O
any O

, O

the O
effect O

any O

The O
finding O
of O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
of O
a O
question O
of O
ultimate O
fact O
derived O
from O
a O
consideration O

though O
requiring O
the O
application O

his O
store O

a O
noise O
at O
the O

He O
opened O
the O

and O
three O
men O
came O
in O
with O
their O

pulled O
down O
over O
their O
foreheads O
, O
and O
one O
of O
them O
pointed O
a O
gun O
at O
him O
and O
told O
him O
that O
he O
would O
kill O
him O
if O
he O
made O
a O
move. O
The O
man O
then O
pushed O
him O
into O
the O
toilet O
with O
his O
face O
to O
the O
*400wall O
, O
searched O
his O
pockets O

in O
the O
toilet O
about O
eight O
minutes O
, O
until O
everything O
was O
quiet O
in O
the O
store O
, O
and O
then O
came O
out O
and O
called O
the O
police. O
The O
robbers O
took O
from O
the O

coats O
, O
fur O
capes O
and O
seal O
scarfs O
, O
of O
the O

of O
about O
$3700. O
Diamond O
was O
unable O
to O
identify O
any O
of O
the O
men O
who O
participated O
in O
the O
robbery O
, O
but O
testified O
that O
when O
he O
saw O
Robinson O
at O
the O
police O
station O
he O
heard O
him O
tell O
the O
police O
that O
he O
(Robinson) O
was O
th\u00e9 O
man O
that O

In O
the O

On O

The O
other O

the O

on O
his O
trial O
was O
given O
mainly O
by O
Yonkowski O
for O
the O
People O

and O
the O
substance O
of O
his O
testimony O
is O
the O

He O
(Yonkowski) O
was O
convicted O
on O
another O
charge O
of O
robbery O
before O
the O

case. O
After O
the O

was O
returned O
in O
the O
other O
case O
, O
and O
before O
he O
was O
sentenced O
, O
he O
stated O
to O
the O

that O
he O
wanted O
to O

and O
made O

His O

is O
that O
he O

On O
the O
day O
of O
the O
present O
robbery O
he O
was O
with O
the O
defendant O
and O
Shyne O
, O
and O
Shyne O
proposed O
that O
they O
make O
some O
money. O
The O
defendant O
, O
Shyne O
and O
a O
man O
named O
Perske O
went O
into O
Diamond\u2019s O
store O
while O
he O
remained O
in O
the O
automobile. O
Shyne O
and O
Perske O
afterwards O
came O
out O
with O
some O
furs O
and O
put O
them O
in O
the O
machine. O
Defendant O
did O
not O
come O
out O
of O
the O
store O
at O
that O
time O
, O
but O
after O
the O
furs O
had O
been O
loaded O
into' O
the O
automobile O
all O
four O
of O
the O
men O
got O
into O
the O

and O
drove O
to O
Louis O
Oliff\u2019s O

, O
but O
before O
they O
arrived O
there O
the O
defendant O
got O
out O
of O
the O

They O

The O

gave O
it O

defendant O
, O
who O

defendant O
and O
the O

cashed O
the O

at O
a O
bank O
at O
Washington O
and O
Halsted O
streets O
and O
defendant O
got O
$215 O
for O
his O
share O
of O
the O
robbery. O
There O
was O
also O
evidence O

Market O

None O
of O
the O
bank O
officers O
could O
identify O
the O
parties O
who O
cashed O
the O
check. O
One O

testified O
that O
her O
son O
, O
a O
co-defendant O
in O
this O
case O
, O
had O
brought O
it O
to O
her O
home O
but O
that O
she O
did O
not O
ask O
him O
where O
he O
got O
it. O
All O
of O
the O
recovered O
furs O
were O
introduced O
in O

and O
were O
identified O
by O
the O
prosecuting O
witness O

Diamond O
, O
as O
the O
property O
that O
was O
in O
his O
store O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
robbery O
. O
The O
defendant O
testified O
in O
his O
own O
behalf O
and O
denied O
all O
knowledge O
of O
the O
robbery O
and O
participation O
therein. O
He O
also O
denied O
receiving O
any O
money O
from O
the O
sale O
of O
the O
furs O
and O
cashing O
the O
check O
given O
by O
Solomon O

denied O

he O
told O
the O

he O
was O
the O

that O
had O
forced O
Diamond O

His O

was O

that O
on O
the O

of O
the O
alleged O

he O

robbery O
, O
and O

on O
March O
10 O
, O
1922 O
, O
(the O
day O
he O
was O
arrested O
, O
) O
he O
met O
Yonkowski O
and O
two O
other O
men O
whom O
he O
did O
not O
know O
but O
since O
learned O
were O
Shyne O
and O
Lubin; O
that O
Yonkowski O
asked O
him O
to O
take O
him O
and O
Shyne O
and O
Lubin O
for O
a O
ride O
, O
and O
that O
while O
they O
were O
joy-riding O
they O
were O
arrested. O
ITe O
denied O
knowing O
anything O
about O
the O
guns O
that O
were O
found O
on O
the O
back O
seat O
of O
the O
automobile O
in O
which O
they O
were O
riding O
. O
Two O
witnesses O
, O
Mrs. O
Rose O
Cooper O
, O
the O
wife O
of O
defendant\u2019s O
partner O
in O
the O
potato O
business O
, O
and O
Louis O
Block O
, O
testified O
that O
the O
defendant O
maintained O
a O
good O
reputation O
for O
honesty O
, O
etc. O
, O
in O
the O
neighborhood O
in O
which O
he O
lived. O
Mrs. O
Cooper O
also O
testified O
that O
she O
knew O
defendant O
was O
peddling O
potatoes O
during O
the O
week O
before O
Christmas O
, O
1921 O
, O
and O
that O
she O
saw O
the O
wagon O
go O
out O
every O
morning O
during O
that O
week O
, O
and O
that O
every O
night O
defendant O
brought O
home O
the O
money O
and O
settled O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
sick O
and O
unable O
to O
help O
him. O
Block O
testified O
that O
he O
lived O
in O
the O
same O
house O
where O
defendant O
lived O
, O
and O
recalled O
having O
seen O
him O
either O
in O
front O
of O
that O
house O
, O
or O
inside O
eating O
breakfast O
, O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
day O
of O
the O
robbery O
, O
about O
6:3o O
. O
The O
two O
alibi O
witnesses O
for O
the O
defense O
did O
not O
account O
for O
the O
whereabouts O
of O
the O
defendant O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
robbery. O
Their O
testimony O
related O
to O
a O
time O
about O
three O
hours O
earlier O
than O
the O
robbery. O
The O
defense O
on O
the O
alibi O
rested O
almost O
solely O
upon O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
defendant O
himself. O
He O
was O
contradicted O
in O
to O
to O
by O
the O
testimony O
of O
Yonkowski O
, O
who O
was O
an O
accomplice O
in O
the O
crime O
committed. O
The O
truth O
of O
Yonkowski\u2019s O
testimony O
is O
strongly O
supported O
by O
the O
testimony O
of O
Diamond O
that O
the O
defendant O
stated O
to O
the O
police O
that O
he O
was O
the O
man O
that O
forced O
Diamond O
into O
the O
toilet O
on O
the O
morning O
of O
the O
robbery. O
The O
jury O
were O
correctly O
instructed O
on O
the O
law O
relating O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
an O
accomplice O
, O
and O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
substantial O
error O
in O
the O
record O
the O
verdict O
of O
the O
jury O
must O
be O
sustained O
. O
Where O
an O
alibi O
is O
relied O
on O
as O
a O
defense O
, O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
it O
it O
is O
incumbent O
on O
the- O
defendant O
to O
support O
it O
*403by O
such O
facts O
and O
circumstances O
as O
are O
sufficient O
, O
when O
considered O
in O
connection O
with O
all O
the O
other O
evidence O
in O
the O
case O
, O
to O
create O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
jury O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
charge O
against O
him. O
The O
defendant O
complains O
of O
an O
instruction O
by O
the O
court O
that O
directed O
the O
jury O
that O
the O
burden O
of O
establishing O
the O
defense O
of O
an O
alibi O
is O
on O
the O
defendant O
, O
and O
to O
maintain O
it O
it O
is O
incumbent O
upon O
him O
to O
prove O
facts O
and O
circumstances O
which O
, O
when O
considered O
in O
connection O
with O
all O
the O
evidence O
relied O
on O
to O
establish O
his O
guilt O
of O
the O
crime O
charged O
, O
are O
sufficient O
to O
create O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
jury O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
charge. O
The O
instruction O
closed O
with O
the O
further O
direction O
that O
if O
the O
evidence O
introduced O
in O
the O
case O
to O
maintain O
the O
defense O
of O
an O
alibi O
, O
when O
considered O
with O
all O
the O
evidence O
relied O
upon O
to O
establish O
defendant\u2019s O
guilt O
of O
the O
crime O
charged O
, O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
create O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
jury O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
charge O
, O
then O
that O
defense O
is O
not O
available O
to O
the O
defendant. O
This O
instruction O
is O
not O
strictly O
accurate. O
The O
burden O
of O
proof O
in O
a O
criminal O
case O
never O
shifts O
to O
the O
defendant; O
and O
this O
is O
true O
whether O
the O
defense O
is O
an O
alibi O
, O
or O
insanity O
, O
or O
other O
defense O
of O
a O
positive O
character. O
The O
defense O
as O
to O
an O
alibi O
and O
the O
character O
of O
proof O
required O
are O
correctly O
stated O
by O
us O
in O
the O
first O
part O
of O
this O
paragraph O
, O
but O
, O
so O
far O
as O
this O
point O
is O
concerned O
, O
the O
jury O
could O
not O
have O
been O
misled O
by O
the O
instruction O
, O
because O
they O
were O
clearly O
informed O
that O
the O
evidence O
for O
the O
defendant O
was O
only O
required O
to O
raise O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
as O
to O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
charge O
. O
The O
real O
, O
substantial O
objection O
made O
by O
the O
defendant O
to O
the O
above O
instruction O
is O
that O
it O
confines O
the O
consideration O
of O
the O
jury O
to O
the O
proof O
of O
the O
alibi O
and O
all O
the O
evidence O
relied O
upon O
to O
establish O
the O
guilt O
of O
the O
defendant O
, O
and O
then O
tells O
the O
jury O
that O
if O
on O
such O
consideration O
they O
find O
the O
evidence O
not O
sufficient O
to O
create O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
of O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
charge O
, O
then O
that O
defense O
is O
not O
available O
to O
the O
defendant. O
The O
law O
is O
that O
the O
jury O
shall O
consider O
all O
*404the O
evidence O
introduced O
bearing O
upon O
the O
defense O
of O
an O
alibi O
and O
shall O
also O
consider O
all O
other O
evidence O
in O
the O
case O
, O
and O
if O
after O
such O
consideration O
there O
arises O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
jury O
as O
to O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
guilt O
he O
should O
be O
acquitted. O
No O
part O
of O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
evidence O
should O
be O
omitted O
from O
this O
consideration. O
He O
had O
a O
right O
to O
have O
his O
evidence O
of O
good O
character O
considered. O
There O
were O
a O
number O
of O
instructions O
given O
to O
the O
jury O
that O
stated O
the O
law O
correctly O
and O
accurately O
to O
the O
jury O
. O
The O
defendant O
also O
asked O
the O
court O
to O
give O
instructions O
to O
the O
jury O
that O
contained O
the O
same O
inaccuracies O
as O
the O
instructions O
concerning O
which O
the O
defendant O
makes O
complaint. O
In O
one O
of O
these O
instructions O
the O
jury O
were O
told O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
for O
the O
defense O
to O
prove O
the O
alibi O
beyond O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
sufficient O
if O
the O
evidence O
introduced O
in O
support O
of O
the O
alibi O
raised O
in O
the O
minds O
of O
the O
jury O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
as O
to O
where O
he O
was O
on O
the O
day O
in O
question. O
By O
this O
instruction O
he O
also O
confined O
his O
defense O
solely O
to O
the O
evidence O
bearing O
on O
the O
alibi O
, O
and O
in O
addition O
to O
that O
had O
the O
jury O
erroneously O
instructed O
that O
if O
they O
entertained O
a O
doubt O
of O
his O
whereabouts O
on O
that O
day O
after O
a O
consideration O
of O
such O
evidence O
it O
was O
their O
duty O
to O
return O
a O
verdict O
of O
not O
guilty. O
The O
reasonable O
doubt O
which O
the O
jury O
should O
entertain O
in O
any O
case O
is O
as O
to O
defendant\u2019s O
guilt O
where O
the O
defense O
is O
an O
alibi O
, O
and O
not O
as O
to O
his O
whereabouts O
at O
the O
time O
the O
crime O
was O
committed. O
(Carlton O
v. O
People O
, O
150 O
Ill. O
181.) O
It O
is O
also O
the O
law O
that O
if O
such O
reasonable O
doubt O
arises O
from O
a O
consideration O
of O
all O
the O
evidence O
the O
defendant O
should O
be O
acquitted. O
But O
a O
defendant O
cannot O
successfully O
complain O
of O
error O
in O
instructions O
when O
the O
same O
error O
, O
in O
substance O
, O
is O
contained O
in O
instructions O
offered O
by O
him O
and O
given O
by O
the O
court O
. O
Defendant O
makes O
the O
objection O
that O
the O
court O
erroneously O
allowed O
the O
witness O
Yonkowski O
to O
detail O
to O
the O
jury O
what O
he O
stated O
before O
the O
court O
after O
he O
had O
been O
convicted O
in O
another O
case O
for O
robber)'-. O
This O
evidence O
was O
very O
objec*405tionable O
, O
and O
it O
was O
particularly O
objectionable O
for O
the O
Statens O
counsel O
to O
ask O
the O
witness O
to O
state O
, O
in O
substance O
, O
that O
he O
there O
wanted O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
concerning O
the O
facts O
in O
this O
case O
and O
that O
he O
told O
the O
judge O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
tell O
the O
truth. O
The O
declarations O
were O
simply O
mere O
unsworn O
declarations O
of O
the O
witness O
out O
of O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
defendant O
and O
were O
not O
competent O
at O
all O
, O
and O
it O
was O
an O
unlawful O
attempt O
by O
the O
State O
to O
give O
undue O
weight O
to O
such O
declarations O
and O
his O
testimony O
by O
having O
the O
witness O
state O
that O
he O
told O
the O
judge O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
and O
that O
he O
did O
tell O
the O
truth. O
The O
fact O
that O
Yonlcowski O
was O
convicted O
of O
robbery O
in O
the O
other O
case O
was O
a O
fact O
that O
the O
jury O
in O
this O
case O
could O
consider O
as O
affecting O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
witness O
, O
and O
the O
State O
apparently O
sought O
to O
have O
the O
jury O
believe O
that O
the O
witness O
should O
be O
considered O
as O
telling O
the O
truth O
merely O
because O
he O
told O
the O
judge O
in O
open O
court O
, O
in O
another O
case O
and O
after O
he O
was O
convicted O
, O
that O
he O
wanted O
to O
tell O
the O
truth O
, O
and O
that O
he O
did O
tell O
the O
truth O
at O
that O
time. O
Any O
declaration O
that O
he O
made O
to O
the O
court O
on O
that O
occasion O
was O
not O
competent O
evidence O
at O
all O
against O
this O
defendant. O
The O
defendant O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
in O
a O
position O
to O
complain O
of O
such O
testimony O
, O
as O
he O
made O
no O
objection O
to O
it O
whatever O
. O
There O
are O
other O
objections O
by O
defendant O
to O
declarations O
of O
witnesses O
made O
outside O
of O
court O
and O
introduced O
in O
evidence O
in O
this O
case O
, O
to O
which O
objection O
was O
made O
by O
defendant O
and O
the O
court O
promptly O
sustained O
the O
objection. O
The O
witnesses O
afterwards O
testified O
to O
the O
same O
declarations O
without O
any O
further O
objection O
by O
the O
defendant O
, O
and O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
he O
has O
no O
cause O
of O
complaint O
here. O
A O
defendant O
must O
make O
timely O
objection O
or O
move O
to O
exclude O
improper O
evidence O
before O
he O
can O
complain O
of O
its O
introduction O
. O
There O
was O
no O
error O
in O
admitting O
the O
testimony O
of O
Mrs. O
Perske O
, O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
her O
son O
, O

on O
a O

before O
an O

, O
confirmed O
the O

. O
Several O
errors O
are O
assigned O
, O
but O
the O
only O
one O
argued O
and O
insisted O
upon O
is O
that O
there O
is O
no O
competent O
evidence O
to O
sustain O
the O
award. O
Both O
parties O
were O
working O
under O
and O
subject O
to O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
Workmen\u2019s O
Compensation O

No O

Stout. O
He O

that O
he O
was O
thirty-six O

that O
he O
had O
worked O
for O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
at O
its O
mine O
for O
a O
year O
or O
two; O
that O
he O
earned O
seven O
or O
eight O
dollars O
a O
day O
, O
and O
that O
he O
*37was O
injured O
in O
the O
mine O
on O
June O
23 O
, O
1920; O
that O
while O
squaring O
down O
a O
place O
in O
his O
room O
in O
the O
mine O
with O
a O
pick O
to. O
set O
up O
a O
drilling O
machine O
a O
piece O
of O
coal O
flew O
out O
and O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
right O
eye; O
that O
the O
accident O
happened O
about O
eleven O
o\u2019clock O
in O
the O
morning; O
that O
no O
one O
was O
with O
him O
when O
it O
occurred O
and O
he O
worked O
on O
till O
3 O
:3o O
in O
the O
afternoon O
of O
that O
day O
, O
which O
was O
the O
usual O
quitting O
time; O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
how O
large O
the O
piece O
of O
coal O
was O
that O
hit O
him O
in O
the O
eye; O
that O
he O
had O
Dr. O
Smith O
examine O
the O
eye O
the O
day O
he O
was O
injured O
, O
and O
that O
though O
witness O
thought O
the O
piece O
of O
coal O
was O
still O
in O
his O
eye O
, O
Dr. O
Smith O
told O
him O
it O
was O
not; O
that O
he O
continued O
at O
work O
the O
next O
day O
and O
the O
second O
day O
following; O
that O
he O
did O
not O
report O
his O
injury O
till O
June O
26 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
told O
the O
boss O
of O
his O
injury O
and O
how O
it O
happened; O
that O
he O
was O
sent O
by O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
to O
Dr. O
Mead O
, O
at O
Pinckneyville O
, O
for O
treatment O
of O
his O
eye O
and O
the O
doctor O
treated O
him O
about O
two O
or O
three O
weeks. O
Witness O
further O
testified O
he O
did O
not O
work O
from O
June O
26 O
until O
August O
24 O
, O
1920 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
went O
back O
to O
the O
same O
work O
in O
the O
mine; O
that O
after O
the O
injury O
he O
loaded O
just O
as O
much O
coal O
as O
before O
but O
that O
he O
could O
not O
see O
out O
of O
his O
right O
eye O
since O
the O
accident; O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
sight O
affected O
his O
ability O
in O
setting O
up O
props O
, O
judging O
shots O
and O
setting O
up O
a O
machine O
, O
and O
that O
he O
could O
not O
clean O
coal O
as O
well O
after O
as O
before O
the O
injury. O
He O
also O
testified O
his O
left O
eye O
was O
all O
right. O
On O
cross-examination O
he O
testified O
he O
had O
some O
five O
or O
six O
years O
previous O
taken O
treatment O
for O
his O
left O
eye O
from O
Dr. O
Wolfer O
, O
of O
St. O
Louis O
. O
At O
the O
hearing O
on O
review O
before O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
offered O
the O
testimony O
of O
Dr. O
Joseph O
M. O
Keller O
and O
Dr. O
M. O
R. O
Damron O
, O
both O
of O
whom O
had O
, O
as O
we O
understand O
the O
record O
, O
examined O
claimant O
at O
the O
instance O
of O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
Dr. O
Keller O
testified O
that O
he O
is O
a O
resident O
of O
St O
Louis O
, O
Missouri O
, O
a O
physician O
and O
surgeon O
, O
and O
an O
instructor O
in O
the O
St. O
Louis O
University O
Medical O
School O
on O
diseases O
of O
the O
eye; O
that O
he O
examined O
the O
eyes O
of O
Stout O
on O
*38March O
28 O
, O
1921 O
, O
and O
described O
the O
appearance O
of O
the O
eyeballs O
and O
lids O
in O
technical O
language O
, O
and O
said O
he O
had O
trachoma O
of O
many O
years\u2019 O
standing O
, O
which O
in O
every-day O
English O
means O
sore O
eyes O
and O
granulated O
lids; O
that O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
eyes O
when O
he O
examined O
them O
in O
March O
, O
1921 O
, O
is O
known O
as O
trachomatous O
pannus O
, O
which O
frequently O
accompanies O
trachoma O
, O
and O
by O
spreading O
over O
the O
pupils O
of O
the O
eye O
causes O
loss O
of O
sight; O
that O
claimant O
told O
him O
he O
had O
once O
previous O
to O
the O
injury O
to O
the O
right O
eye O
, O
and O
once O
afterwards O
, O
sustained O
injuries O
to O
the O
left O
eye. O
He O
further O
testified O
that O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
eyes O
was O
of O
several O
years\u2019 O
standing; O
that O
if O
claimant O
had O
received O
an O
injury O
there O
would O
be O
some O
evidence O
of O
it O
and O
that O
he O
saw O
no O
evidence O
of O
an O
injury; O
that O
a O
slight O
injury O
might O
not O
show O
, O
but O
if O
it O
was O
severe O
there O
would O
be O
evidence O
of O
it O
. O
Dr. O
Damron O
testified O
he O
specialized O
in O
eye O
treatment; O
that O
he O
examined O
claimant\u2019s O
eyes O
in O
January O
, O
1921 O
, O
and O
found O
evidences O
of O
an O
old O
trachomic O
ulcer; O
that O
both O
eyes O
were O
inflamed O
, O
with O
practically O
no O
vision O
in O
the O
right O
eye; O
that O
the O
condition O
evidenced O
trachoma O
of O
long O
standing; O
that O
an O
injury O
to O
the O
eye O
would O
have O
aggravated O
the O
ulcer O
, O
but O
he O
found O
no O
evidence O
of O
an O
injury; O
that O
if O
the O
eye O
had O
received O
an O
injury O
in O
June O
, O
1920 O
, O
of O
such O
seriousness O
as O
to O
affect O
it O
, O
he O
would O
have O
observed O
some O
evidence O
of O
it O
. O
Dr. O
Mead O
, O
to O
whom O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
sent O
claimant O
when O
notified O
of O
the O
injury O
and O
who O
treated O
him O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
, O
was O
not O
called O
to O
testify O
. O
It O
has O
been O
frequently O
held O
that O
the O
burden O
is O
on O
the O
applicant O
to O
prove O
he O
was O
accidentally O
injured O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
injury. O
The O
cases O
are O
so O
familiar O
as O
not O
to O
require O
citation O
. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
question O
that O
the O
testimony O
of O
claimant O
, O
considered O
alone O
, O
made O
a O
case O
which O
justified O
the O
award O
, O
but O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
contends O
that O
when O
the O
testimony O
of O
Drs. O
Keller O
and O
Damron O
is O
considered O
the O
whole O
evidence O
shows O
that O
.the O
condition O
of O
claimant\u2019s O
right O
eye O
*39was O
not O
due O
to O
an O
accidental O
injury O
but O
was O
due O
to O
a O
preexisting O
disease O
not O
connected O
with O
any O
accident O
arising O
out O
of O
his O
employment. O

The O
only O
way O
in O
which O
there O
was O
any O
contradiction O
of O
claimant\u2019s O
testimony O
that O
he O
was O
accidentally O
injured O
was O
by O
the O
testimony O
of O
Drs. O
Keller O
and O
Damron O
that O
there O
were O
no O
evidences O
of O
such O
an O
injury O
when O
they O
examined O
the O
eye O
in O
January O
and O
March O
, O
1921. O
As O
to O
the O
fact O
of O
there O
having O
been O
accidental O
injury O
to O
the O
eye O
June O
23 O
, O
1920 O
, O
it O
cannot O
be O
said O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
expert O
witnesses O
must O
be O
held O
to O
conclusively O
overcome O
claimant\u2019s O
testimony O
and O
establish O
that O
there O
was O
no O
accidental O
injury. O
The O
reason O
why O
this O
is O
so O
is O
so O
obvious O
as O
not O
to O
require O
discussion. O
The O
weight O
of O
the O
proof O
does O
, O
we O
think O
, O
show O
claimant O
had O
diseased O
eyes O
before O
the O
injury O
, O
but O
it O
was O
a O
controverted O
question O
whether O
the O
loss O
of O
vision O
of O
the O
right O
eye O
was O
due O
to O
an O
injury O
or O
to O
preexisting O
disease. O
In O
determining O
that O
question O
it O
was O
the O
province O
and O
duty O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
to O
consider O
all O
the O
testimony O
and O
give O
it O
such O
weight O
as O
under O
all O
the O
circumstances O
it O
was O
entitled O
to. O
The O
commission O
could O
not O
arbitrarily O
disregard O
any O
of O
the O
testimony O
, O
but O
it O
was O
its O
duty O
to O
reasonably O
and O
fairly O
consider O
the O
evidence O
of O
both O
parties O
in O
determining O
the O
issues. O
It O
was O
proper O
to O
consider O
the O
character O
of O
the O
testimony O
, O
who O
the O
witnesses O
were O
, O
their O
opportunities O
for O
knowing O
the O
truth O
of O
the O
matters O
testified O
to O
by O
them O
, O
and O
all O
other O
matters O
which O
tended O
to O
affect O
the O
weight O
and O
credit O
that O
should O
be O
given1 O
their O
testimony. O
We O
do O
not O
think O
this O
court O
would O
be O
warranted O
in O
reversing O
the O
judgment O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
the O
award O
was O
clearly O
contrary O
to O
the O
evidence. O
Notwithstanding O
the O
testimony O
of O
plaintiff O
in O
error\u2019s O
expert O
witnesses O
that O
there O
were O
no O
evidences O
of O
an O
accidental O
injury O
, O
it O
cannot O
reasonably O
be O
said O
the O
commission O
was O
bound O
to O
find O
that O
there O
was O
no O
such O
injury. O
Both O
of O
the O
experts O
testified O
that O
an O
*40injury O
would O
aggravate O
the O
condition O
described. O
Claimant O
testified O
his O
left O
eye O
had O
been O
accidentally O
injured O
twice O
, O
but O
the O
injuries O
did O
not O
destroy O
the O
sight O
of O
that O
eye. O
The O
loss O
of O
vision O
of O
the O
right O
eye O
, O
for O
which O
the O
award O
was O
made O
, O
was O
claimed O
to O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
an O
injury O
June O
23 O
, O
1920. O
In O
view O
of O
the O
record O
we O
cannot O
say O
the O
commission O
should O
have O
accepted O
and O
acted O
on O
the O
. O
testimony O
of O
the O
witnesses O
of O

Her O
application O
as O
amended O
claimed O
ownership O
in O
fee O
not O
subject O
to O
homestead O
and O
described O
the O
real O

involved. O
Her O
application O
also O
set O
*505out O
that O

is O

occupied O
by O
Albert O

, O

In O

Some O

the O

The O

that O

are O
entitled O
to O
recover O
$1020.17 O

interest O
on O

entered O

Defendant O
in O

on O

After O
submission O
of O
the O

plaintiffs O
in O

filed O
their O
itiotion O
in O
this O

of O
the O

on O

his O
signing O
the O
certificate O

the O
close O
of O
the O
term O

as O
was O
done. O
Plaintiffs O
in O
error O
by O
the O

motion O
asked O
leave O
to O
file O
a O
supplemental O
transcript O
showing O
a O

before O
the O

on O
a O

motion O

additional O
transcript O
for O
the O
reasons O
herein O
set- O
out. O
These O
motions O
were O
taken O
with O
the O
case. O
The O
record O
sufficiently O
shows O
that O
the O
transcript O
of O
evidence O
was O
presented O
to O
the O
chancellor O
at O
the O
time O
the O
decree O
was O
presented O
and O
filed O
but O
was O
not O
signed O
by O
him O
at O
that O
time O
through O
inadvertence O
and O
oversight. O
It O
was O
not O
error O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
chancellor O
, O
therefore O
, O
to O
sign O
the O
same O
after O
the O
close O
of O
the O
term O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
its O
presentation O
and O
filing. O
Plaintiffs O
in O
error O
complain O
that O
they O
did O
not O
have O
notice O
of O
the O
actual O
signing O
of O
the O

This O
was O
not O
necessary. O
They O

Their O
motion O

is O
contended O
by O
plaintiffs O
in O

that O
the O
evidence O
taken O
before O
the O

was'insufficient O
to O
establish O
the O

reason O
the O

not O

aside O
the O

On O
the O

he O
is O
currently O

teacher O
in O
the O

for O
ten O
years O
and O
received O
his O
master\u2019s O
degree O

David O
testified O
that O
tire O
tire O
swing O
was O
fun O
for O
children O
and O
encouraged O
socialization. O
He O
stated O
that O
he O
would O
typically O
push O
the O
children O
by O
holding O
the O
chains O
in O
two O
spots O
and O
initiating O
a O
circular O
motion O
and O
that O
he O
frequently O
reminded O
the O
children O
to O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
chains O
. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
Krystal\u2019s O
accident O
, O
Mr. O
Martines O
pushed O
the O
swing O
as O
he O
normally O
would O
, O
the O
children O
appeared O
to O
be O
having O
a O
good O
time O
and O
he O
did O
not O
hear O
Krystal O
ask O

stop O
the O
swing. O
David O
testified O
that O
they O
were O
on O

when O

let O
go O

David O
estimated O
that O
while O

had O
turned O
his O
back O
slightly O
to O
clear O
his O
body O
from O

motion O
of O

swing. O
He O
concluded O
that O
there O
was O
nothing O
he O
could O
have O
done O
to O
prevent O
Krystal O
from O
falling O
. O
Neither O
party O
submitted O
a O
brief O
in O
support O
of O
their O
claim O
. O
The O
law O
is O
well O
established O
that O
in O
order O
to O
maintain O
an O
action O
in O
negligence O
the O
Claimant O
must O
establish O
by O
a O
preponderance O
of O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
Respondent O
owed O
Claimant O
a O
duty O
, O
that O
the O
duty O
to O
Claimant O
was O
breached O
by O
a O
negligent O
act O
or O
omission O
to O
act O
, O
and O
that O
the O
negligence O
proximately O
caused O
the O
compensable O
injury. O

, O

. O
In O
this O
case O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
, O
as O
a O
minor O
child O
in O
the O
charge O
of O
the O
State-operated O
facility O
, O
Claimant O
was O
entitled O
to O
an O
expectation O
of O
reasonable O
care. O
The O
Claimants O
complaint O
alleges O
that O
the O
State O
was O
negligent O
by O
allowing O
the O
swing O
to O
be O
in O
a O
defective O
condition O
and O
by O
failing O
to O
warn O
Claimant O
of O
the O
defect. O
However O
, O
at O
hearing O
the O
Claimant O
did O
not O
offer O
any O
evidence O
that O
the O
swing O
was O
defective O
or O
in O
disrepair O
. O
The O
issue O
at O
the O
hearing O
primarily O
centered O
on O
an O
alleged O
failure O
by O
the O
caretakers O
or O
teachers O
to O
properly O
supervise O
the O
young O
students O
, O
although O
those O
allegations O
were O
never O
made O
in O
the O
complaint O
. O
The O
facts O
are O
basically O
uncontested O
that O
there O
were O
two O
qualified O
teachers O
physically O
present O
and O
supervising O
a O
group O
of O
15 O
children O
in O
the O
play O
lot O
of O
the O
Childrens O
Center. O
One O
of O
the O
teachers O
was O
pushing O
Claimant O
and O
two O
other O
children O
in O
a O
reasonable O
and O
usual O
manner O
for O
about O
one O
minute O
when O
the O
four-year-old O
Claimant O
became O
*351frightened O
or O
dizzy O
and O
let O
go O
of O
the O
chains O
, O
causing O
her O
to O
fall O
backwards O
from O
the O
swing O
. O
Both O
the O
Claimant O
and O
the O
teacher O
established O
that O
the O
Claimant O
had O
been O
on O
the O
swing O
many O
times O
prior O
to O
the O
date O
of O
her O
fall O
without O
incident O
. O
Clearly O
, O
the O
injury O
to O
the O
Claimant O
was O
an O
unfortunate O
incident O
, O
but O
there O
is O
not O
credible O
evidence O
to O
establish O
that O
the O
Respondent O
or O
its O
agents O
were O
in O
any O
way O
negligent O
by O
act O
or O
omission. O
The O
teachers O
acted O
reasonably O
and O
with O
due O
care O
for O
the O
Claimant. O
The O
Claimant O
, O
even O
at O
age O
eight O
, O
is O
a O
soft-spoken O
, O
mild-mannered O
young O
lady O
and O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
if O
she O
did O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
ask O
David O
to O
stop O
the O
swing O
, O
he O
did O
not O
hear O
her O
. O
The O
Claimant O
in O
this O
case O
has O
failed O
to O
meet O
her O
burden O
of O
proof. O
This O
claim O
is O
hereby O
denied O

On O
December O
22 O
, O
1985 O
, O
an O
employee O
, O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
, O
came O
to O
Claimants O
cell. O
He O
asked O
Claimant O
to O
sweep O
the O
day O
room O
and O
clean O
the O
tables. O
Claimant O
did O
what O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
requested O
and O
returned O
to O
his O
cell. O
Approximately O
30 O
minutes O
after O
returning O
to O
his O
cell O
, O
Officer O
Bassett O
told O
Claimant O
that O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
had O
instructed O
him O
to O
tell O
Claimant O
to O
move O
the O
washer O
and O
dryer. O
Claimant O
told O
Officer O
Bassett O
that O
he O
had O
a O
back O
problem O
and O
was O
not O
supposed O
to O
move O
anything O
heavy. O
Claimant O
told O
Officer O
Bassett O
that O
he O
could O
call O
the O
health O
care O
unit O
and O
verify O
Claimants O
condition. O
Officer O
Bassett O
said O
he O
had O
an O
order O
from O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
and O
Claimant O
would O
be O
written O
up O
for O
refusing O
it O
. O
Claimant O
did O
not O
want O
to O
be O
written O
up. O
He O
went O
over O
to O
the O
washer O
and O
tilted O
it O
towards O
him. O
He O
began O
to O
*167wiggle O
the O
washer O
and O
to O
get O
it O
out O
and O
his O
back O
gave O
out. O
He O
got O
a O
pop O
in O
his O
back O
, O
his O
back O
went O
out O
and O
he O
hit O
the O
floor. O
The O
washer O
was O
on O
him O
and O
he O
hit O
his O
head. O
After O
the O
washer O
was O
lifted O
off O
of O
him O
, O
Claimant O
was O
in O
severe O
pain O
and O
crying. O
He O
was O
not O
able O
to O
move. O
The O
health O
unit O
put O
him O
on O
a O
stretcher. O
The O
nurses O
took O
him O
to O
the O
health O
care O
unit O
, O
noticed O
he O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
swelling O
in O
his O
back O
and O
called O
Dr. O
Shoaff O
regarding O
his O
back. O
If O
Claimant O
informed O
him O
of O
a O
back O
problem O
, O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
would O
not O
have O
called O
the O
health O
care O
unit O
to O
verify O
it O
. O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
believed O
it O
was O
unreasonable O
to O
tilt O
the O
washer O
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
scoot O
it. O
He O
did O
not O
tell O
Claimant O
how O
to O
move O
the O
washer. O
He O
acknowledged O
that O
the O
end O
of O
the O
wall O
(across O
from O
the O
washer) O
, O
depicted O
in O

six O
to O
eight O
inches O
short O

being O
flush O
with O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
washer. O
He O
did O
not O
see O
Claimant O
under O
the O
washer. O
When O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
helped O
the O
medical O
staff O
lift O
him O
, O
Claimant O
appeared O
to O
be O
in O
pain O
. O
Both O
parties O
indicated O
that O
they O
would O
waive O
closing O
arguments O
at O
the O
hearing O
and O
present O
them O
in O
their O
briefs. O
Neither O
party O
filed O
a O
brief O
. O
To O
prevail O
on O
a O
claim O
of O
negligence O
, O
Claimant O
must O
prove O
by O
a O
preponderance O
of O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
State O
had O
a O
duty O
to O
protect O
Claimant O
from O
harm O
, O
that O
the O
State O
negligently O
breached O
that O
duty O
, O
and O
that O
the O
negligence O
was O
the O
proximate O
cause O
of O
Claimants O
injury. O

The O

must O
exercise O
reasonable O

(Starks O

In O
Starks O
, O
the O
Court O
found O
that O
Claimant O
failed O
to O
meet O
his O

there O
was O

However O
, O
a O

not O

that O

in O

Dr. O

concluded O
in O

, O
\u201cthat O
there O
appears O

The O

states O
that O

no O

A O

of O
his O
spine O
apparently O
showed O
that O
certain O

were O
extending O

Claimant O
testified O
that O
Officer O
Bassett O
told O
him O
to O
move O
the O
washer O
and O
dryer O
and O
he O
told O
Officer O
Bassett O
that O
he O
had O
a O
back O
problem. O
There O
are O
no O
witnesses O
to O
this O
conversation. O
There O
were O
no O
witnesses O
to O
the O
actual O
incident O
. O
We O
are O
not O
aware O
of O
a O
claim O
where O
a O
prisoner O
was O
ordered O
to O
perform O
a O
task O
that O
was O
allegedly O
contrary O
to O
his O
known O
medical O
condition O
. O
Although O
the O
record O
indicates O
that O
Claimant O
, O
on O
numerous O
occasions O
, O
informed O
the O
Respondent O
of O
prior O
back O
problems O
and O
of O
back O
pain O
, O
we O
find O
, O
as O
we O
did O
in O
Komeshak O
v. O
State O
(1985) O
, O
38 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
100 O
, O
that O
Claimant O
has O
not O
met O
his O
burden O
of O
proof. O
We O
find O
that O
Claimant O
has O
not O
shown O
that O
Respondent O
has O
breached O
its O
duty O
to O
exercise O
ordinary O
and O
reasonable O
care. O
This O
recommendation O
is O
based O
on O
Claimant\u2019s O
testimony. O
He O
did O
not O
indicate O
that O
he O
requested O
help O
in O
moving O
the O
washer. O
Both O
witnesses O
for O
Respondent O
indicated O
that O
a O
prisoner O
could O
, O
and O
does O
, O
request O
help O
to O
perform O
certain O
tasks O
from O
inmates O
or O
employees. O
Claimant O
did O
not O
refute O
or O
rebut O
this O
testimony. O
Claimant O
knew O
his O
own O
condition O
and O
, O
if O
it O
was O
such O
that O
he O
could O
not O
move O
the O
washer O
by O
himself O
, O
he O
*170should O
have O
told O
Lt. O
Hoepker O
or O
Officer O
Bassett O
that O
he O
needed O
help. O
Claimant O
was O
a O
porter O
for O
nearly O
five O
months. O
His O
cleaning O
duties O
required O
physical O
activity O
and O
Claimant O
apparently O
voluntarily O
performed O
these O
duties O
. O
A O
review O

does O
not O
reveal O
that O
Respondent O
had O
notice O
of O
any O
specific O
physical O
or O
medical O
problem O
that O
would O
limit O
Claimants O
activities. O
There O
apparently O
was O
a O
procedure O
to O
be O
followed O
in O
the O
event O
a O
prisoner O
was O
to O
be O
limited O
in O
his O
physical O

there O
is O
no O

that O

The O
unusual O
twist O
in O
this O
case O
is O
that O
the O
meaning O
of O
\u201cknowingly\u201d O
\u2014 O
the O
allegedly O
false O
allegation O
\u2014 O
was O
itself O
a O
disputed O
issue O
in O
the O
administrative O
proceeding. O
The O
*314Claimant O
took O
the O
position O
then O
, O
and O
adheres O
to O
it O
now O
, O
that O
IDOT\u2019s O
stipulation O
that O
Orbit\u2019s O
truck O
driver O
did O
not O
have O
\u201cactual O
knowledge\u201d O
that O
the O
placard O
was O
missing O
is O
terminally O
dispositive O
of O
the O
violation O
charge. O
On O
Claimant\u2019s O
view O
, O
the O
\u201cknowingly\u201d O
allegation O
meant O
, O
and O
under O
the O
Illinois O
statute O
and O
IDOT O
regulations O
had O
to O
mean O
, O
\u201cactually O
knew\u201d O
and O
that O
that O
was O
admitted O
to O
be O
false O
by O
IDOT\u2019s O
stipulation O
. O
IDOT O
takes O
the O
view O
that O
\u201cknowingly\u201d O
was O
intended O
by O
IDOT O
to O
mean O
\u201cconstructively O
knew O
, O
\u201d O
and O
that O
it O
clearly O
and O
explicitly O
confirmed O
that O
by O
the O
pre-trial O
stipulation. O
Under O
that O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
interpretation O
, O
IDOT O
contends O
that O
its O
allegation O
of O
\u201cknowingly\u201d O
was O
reasonable O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
reasonable O
and O
properly O
aggressive O
attempt O
to O
obtain O
a O
stricter O
judicial O
interpretation O
of O
the O
statute O
that O
would O
be O
more O
favorable O
to O
enforcement O
of O
the O
Act. O
IDOT O
argues O
strenuously O
that O
it O
ought O
not O
be O
penalized O
\u2014 O
or O
at O
least O
not O
forced O
to O
pay O
Orbit\u2019s O
litigation O
expenses O
\u2014 O
because O
it O
sought O
to O
advocate O
a O
legally O
plausible O
, O
but O
unsuccessful O
, O
interpretation O
of O
the O
law.1 O
Respondent O
urges O
that O
it O
acted O
reasonably O
at O
all O
stages O
of O
the O
administrative O
proceeding O
, O
and O
that O
APA O
section O
55(a) O
requires O
a O
much O
more O
egregious O
behavior O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
agency O
before O
liability O
is O
imposed O
. O
Both O
sides O
agree O
that O
the O
administrative O
action O
proceeded O
to O
trial O
on O
IDOT\u2019s O
legal O
theory O
that O
the O
Act O
and O
regulations O
should O
be O
construed O
only O
to O
require O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
that O
the O
placard O
was O
missing O
, O
i.e. O
, O
*315that O
the O
Orbit O
driver O
was O
somehow O
negligent O
or O
derelict O
of O
his O
duty O
in O
not O
determining O
that O
the O
placard O
had O
somehow O
come O
off O
the O
side O
of O
the O
truck O
during O
the O
first O
few O
hours O
of O
driving O
that O
day O
(after O
undisputedly O
leaving O
the O
dock O
with O
all O
signs O
in O
place). O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
IDOT O
hearing O
officer O
accepted O
this O
theory O
or O
at O
least O
applied O
it O
in O
this O
case O
. O
As O
Claimant O
emphasizes O
, O
the O
hearing O
officer O
applied O
the O
lower O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
standard O
of O
scienter O
to O
this O
case O
and O
found O
it O
unproven O
by O
IDOT O
, O
which O
Claimant O
contends O
is O
tantamount O
to O
a O
finding O
that O
the O
allegation O
was O
untrue O
. O
Under O
the O
circumstances O
presented O
here O
, O
we O
do O
not O
find O
it O
necessary O
to O
reach O
several O
of O
these O
interesting O
issues O
raised O
by O
the O
parties O
, O
including O
the O
issues O
of O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
\u201cuntrue O
allegation\u201d O
liability O
of O
APA O
section O
10 O
\u2014 O
55(a) O
includes O
allegations O
of O
law O
as O
well O
as O
allegations O
of O
fact O
, O
a O
point O
on O
which O
neither O
party O
has O
produced O
precedent O
or O
analysis O
. O
Our O
following O
findings O
suffice O
for O
us O
to O
decide O
the O
dispositive O
issue O
under O
the O
section O
10 O
\u2014 O
55(a) O
standard O
of O
liability O
for O
\u201cuntrue O
allegations\u201d O
in O
IDOTs O
charge O
against O
this O
Claimant: O
1. O
IDOTs O
administrative O
complaint O
alleged O
\u201cknowing\u201d O
misconduct O
under O
an O
Illinois O
statute O
that O
, O
on O
its O
face O
, O
and O
as O
then O
construed O
to O
date O
, O
required O
actual O
knowledge O
in O
order O
to O
trigger O
a O
civil O
penalty; O
no O
regulatory O
gloss O
purported O
to O
alter O
that O
statutory O
standard O
of O
scienter; O
IDOTs O
complaint O
sought O
a O
civil O
penalty O
against O
the O
Claimant O
and O
thus O
invoked O
the O
\u201cknowingly\u201d O
standard; O
2. O
In O
order O
to O
plead O
its O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
theory O
of O
Claimant\u2019s O
liability O
, O
IDOTs O
complaint O
could O
have O
, O
but O
did O
not O
, O
allege O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
as O
a O
*316fact O
conclusion O
and O
could O
have O
, O
but O
did O
not O
, O
allege O
facts O
known O
or O
thought O
to O
be O
known O
to O
the O
Claimant O
(i.e. O
, O
to O
its O
driver O
or O
other O
personnel) O
that O
might O
support O
a O
conclusion O
of O
such O
constructive O
knowledge; O
this O
traditional O
pleading O
technique O
was O
not O
utilized O
by O
IDOT O
in O
this O
case; O
3. O
From O
the O
time O
of O
the O
IDOT-Orbit O
stipulation O
, O
Claimant O
was O
not O
, O
and O
knew O
it O
was O
not O
, O
defending O
a O
charge O
of O
\u201cactual O
knowledge\u201d O
of O
the O
missing O
placard; O
but O
this O
case O
does O
not O
involve O
bad O
faith O
or O
intentional O
deception O
by O
IDOT; O
4. O
The O
IDOT O
administrative O
hearing O
officer O
accepted O
the O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
application O
of O
the O
Act O
insofar O
as O
he O
applied O
that O
construction O
of O
the O
\u201cknowing\u201d O
element O
to O
the O
facts O
presented O
by O
IDOT O
at O
the O
administrative O
hearing O
, O
and O
found O
that O
IDOT O
failed O
to O
prove O
that O
Orbit O
(i.e. O
, O
Orbits O
driver) O
had O
constructive O
knowledge O
of O
the O
missing O
placard;2 O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
complicating O
factors O
, O
this O
finding O
is O
tantamount O
to O
a O
determination O
that O
the O
charge O
was O
untrue; O
5. O
In O
this O
Court O
and O
in O
the O
administrative O
hearing O
below O
, O
IDOT O
failed O
to O
make O
any O
significant O
showing O
of O
a O
factual O
basis O
for O
its O
allegation O
of O
\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d O
of O
the O
missing O
placard. O
IDOT O
failed O
to O
show O
a O
reasonable O
basis O
for O
alleging O
that O
the O
Orbit O
driver O
, O
at O
any O
time O
during O
approximately O
two O
hours O
of O
highway O
driving O
after O
leaving O
his O
departure O
point O
with O
all O
required O
hazardous O
material O
placards O
duly O
affixed O
in O
compliance O
with O
the O
IDOT O
regulations O
, O
and O
affixed O
in O
a O
manner O
that O
met O
IDOT O
regulations O
, O
knew O
facts O
that O
should O
have O
indicated O
to O
him O
, O
or O
otherwise O
had O
reason O
to O
know O
, O
that O
one O
hazardous O
materials O
placard O
had O
come O
off O
of O
tire O
truck O
. O
*317These O
findings O
require O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
IDOT O
has O
breached O
the O
standard O
of O
section O
10 O
\u2014 O
55(a) O
by O
its O
factual O
allegation O
of O
\u201cknowing\u201d O
violation O
, O
under O
both O
an O
actual O
knowledge O
and O
a O
constructive O
knowledge O
interpretation. O
Either O
way O
, O
the O
allegation O
was O
not O
reasonably O
made O
in O
this O
case. O
Claimant O
is O
entitled O
to O
an O
award O
of O
litigation O
expenses O
under O
the O
statute O
. O
However O
, O
in O
awarding O
litigation O
expenses O
under O
this O
statute O
, O
we O
are O
commanded O
to O
award O
only O
such O
expenses O
, O
including O

, O
that O
were O
\u201cactually O
incurred O
in O
defending O
against O
the O
[offending] O
allegation O
# O
* O
V\u2019 O
Because O
of O
the O
shifting O
meaning O
of O
the O
critical O
allegation O
during O
the O
administrative O
proceedings O
, O
our O
award O
determination O
requires O
further O
comment O
. O
Ordinarily O
, O
the O
defense O
of O
an O
allegation O
would O
seemingly O
require O
the O
allegation O
to O
have O
been O
made. O
Ordinarily O
, O
recoverable O
defense O
expenses O
based O
on O
an O
improper O
allegation O
would O
exclude O
defense O
efforts O
preceding O
the O
making O
of O
the O
allegation. O
However O
, O
under O
the O
peculiar O
procedural O
facts O
involved O
in O
this O
administrative O
action O
, O
where O
the O
legal O
and O
factual O
issues O
are O
so O
closely O
intertwined O
, O
where O

as O
the O
second O
(\u201cconstructive O
knowledge\u201d) O
interpretative O
version O
of O
the O
unreasonable/false O
allegation O
was O
false O
, O
and O
where O
the O
administrative O
Respondent O
from O
the O
outset O
had O
to O
defend O
itself O
against O
baseless O
charges O
, O
we O
are O
not O
inclined O
to O
draw O
fine O
lines O
to O
demark O
the O
onset O
of O
the O
recoverable O
defense O
expenses O
, O
and O
we O
are O
not O
persuaded O
that O
Claimant\u2019s O
knowledge O
of O
the O
intended O
meaning O
of O
the O
charge O
is O
a O
reason O
to O
reduce O
its O

in O

circumstances O

Accordingly O
, O
we O
will O
award O
Claimant O
his O
requested O

the O
Claimant O
bears O
the O
burden O

by O

of O
the O

that O
the O
State O
breached O

The O
State O
has O
been O
found O
negligent O
in O
cases O
where O
warning O
signs O
have O
been O
damaged O
or O
removed. O
In O
White-house O
Trucking O
Co. O
, O
the O
State O
had O
excavated O
sections O
of O
a O
highway O
, O
and O
workers O
had O
erected O
barricades O
and O
put O
out O
flares O
to O
warn O
oncoming O
vehicles O
of O
the O
dangerous O
condition O
of O
the O

However O
, O
by O
the O
time O
of O
the O
accident O
, O
*254the O
flares O
were O
put O
out O
by O
the O
rain O
, O
and O
the O
barricades O
had O
blown O
over O
in O
a O

The O
Court O
found O
that O
when O
the O
State O
removes O
a O
section O
of O
the O
pavement O
, O
and O
thereafter O
leaves O
the O
excavation O
open O
at O

that O
adequate O
warning O
devices O
are O
installed O
about O
the O

area. O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
Court O
stated O
that O
once O
the O
warning O
devices O
are O
in O
place O
, O
it O
is O
the O
duty O
of O
the O
State O
to O
take O
reasonable O
precautions O
to O
see O
that O
such O
warning O
devices O
remain O
in O

The O
key O
difference O
between O
these O
cases O
and O
the O
instant O
case O
is O
that O
, O
in O
the O
cases O
cited O
above O
, O
the O
hazards O
the O
State O
failed O
to O
warn O
against O
either O
were O
created O
by O
the O
State O
or O
were O
known O
to O
the O
State. O
In O
Whitehouse O
Trucking O
Co. O
, O
the O
State O
had O
created O
that O
hazard O
and O
had O
an O
additional O
duty O
to O
ensure O
that O
warning O
signs O
remained O
effective. O
In O
Linebaugh O
, O
employees O
of O
the O
State O
were O
aware O
that O
persons O
unknown O
were O
removing O
the O
barricade O
. O
In O
the O
instant O
case O
, O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
hazard O
complained O
of O
, O
an O
unmarked O
intersection O
, O
was O
caused O
by O
Respondent O
or O
was O
known O
to O
Respondent. O
There O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
any O
complaints O
to O
Respondent O
regarding O
the O
stop O
sign O
, O
and O
the O
Department O
of O
Transportation O
workers O
testified O
that O
while O
they O
were O
worldng O
in O
the O
area O
just O
days O
before O
the O
accident O
, O
they O
did O
not O
remove O
the O
sign O
or O
notice O
that O
it O
was O
missing O
. O
Furthermore O
, O
Claimant O
has O
produced O
no O
persuasive O
evidence O
to O
show O
that O
the O
condition O
was O
of O
such O
a O
nature O
*255as O
to O
have O
been O
evident O
, O
nor O
evidence O
to O
show O
the O
duration O
of O
the O
hazard O
, O
in O
order O
to O
show O
constructive O
knowledge O
of O
the O
hazard. O
Although O
the O
Morgan O
County O
deputies O
testified O
that O
the O
grass O
under O
the O
sign O
had O
turned O
yellow O
, O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
to O
show O
how O
long O
the O
metal O
sign O
had O
to O
he O
in O
the O
sun O
in O
August O
to O
turn O
grass O
yellow O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
Claimant O
may O
have O
been O
contributorily O
negligent O
for O
attempting O
to O
accelerate O
his O
vehicle O
when O
he O
saw O
the O
approaching O
vehicle O
, O
which O
could O
bar O
him O
from O
recovering O
even O
if O
Respondent O
were O
found O
to O
be O
negligent O
. O
Based O
upon O
the O
foregoing O
, O
we O
hold O
that O
Claimants O
claim O
is O
denied O
because O
he O
failed O
to O
show O
Respondent O
had O
created O
the O
hazard O
in O
question O
, O
that O
Respondent O
had O
actual O
or O
constructive O
notice O
of O
a O
dangerous O
condition O

the O
parties O

The O

binding O
on O
IDOT O
, O
notwithstanding O
its O
status O
as O

agency O
of O

that O

that O
were O
lawfully O
imposed O
on O

that O

*393Respondent O
IDOT O
contends O
(1) O
that O
the O
State O
, O
as O
sovereign O
, O
is O
not O
bound O
by O
covenants O
running O
with O
land O
that O
it O
acquires O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
based O
apparently O
on O
the O
doctrine O
of O
sovereign O
immunity; O
(2) O
that O
the O
declaration O
and O
its O
covenants O
are O
not O
express O
contracts O
, O
but O
are O
instead O
\u201cimplied O
contracts\u201d O
which O
are O
unenforceable O
against O
the O
State O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law; O
(3) O
that O
the O
declaration O
conflicts O
with O
the O
Illinois O
Purchasing O
Act O
and O
is O
thus O
unenforceable O
against O
the O
State; O
(4) O
that O
even O
if O
the O
subdivision O
covenants O
are O
theoretically O
binding O
on O
the O
State O
, O
no O
money O
judgment O
may O
be O
imposed O

the O
State O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
appropriation O
for O
the O
particular O
contractual O
purpose; O
and O
(5) O
that O
the O
express O
language O
of O
the O
declaration O
exempts O
or O
excludes O
these O
parcels O
from O
the O
operation O
of O
the O
covenants O
because O
the O
parcels O
were O
acquired O
by O
a O
public O
body O
for O
highway O
purposes; O
(6) O
that O
the O
State O
is O
not O
obligated O
to O
pay O
association O
assessments O
because O
it O
does O
not O
and O
will O
not O
receive O
any O
benefit O
from O
such O
payments; O
and O
(7) O
that O
the O
State O
is O
not O
liable O
for O
attorneys O

or O
interest O
absent O
a O
statute O
so O
providing O
. O
In O
reply O
to O

contentions O
, O
the O
Claimant O
argues O
(a) O
that O
the O
declaration O
and O
its O
covenants O
are O
express O
, O
not O
implied O
, O
contracts; O
(b) O
that O
the O

does O
not O
apply O
to O
those O
covenants O
, O
and O
specifically O
not O
to O
the O
covenant O
to O

assessments; O
(c) O
that O
a O
specific O
appropriation O
is O
unnecessary O
for O
an O
award O
to O
be O
made; O
that O
a O
lapsed O
appropriation O
is O
adequate; O
and O
that O
the O
1990-1995 O
appropriations O
for O

appropriations O

not O

Applicability O
of O

Subject O

. O
The O
Court O
must O
first O
address O
the O
interpretative O
issue O
raised O
by O
IDOT. O
As O
Respondent O
points O
out O
, O
the O
other O
issues O
in O
this O

are O
moot O
if O
the O
property O
is O
not O

to O

, O
which O
is O
the O

However O
, O
we O
do O
not O
accept O
the O
Respondents O
interpretation O
of O
the O
exemption O
language O
in O
the O
declaration O
. O
Respondent O
contends O
that O
its O
acquisition O
of O
the O
four O

brings O
that O
land O
within O
the O
language O
and O
intent O
of O
the O

of O
the O

\u201cSection O

The O
following O
property O
subject O
to O
this O
Declaration O
shall O
be O
exempt O
from O
the O
assessments O
created O
herein O
. O
(a) O
All O
property O
dedicated O
to O
and O
accepted O
by O
a O
local O
public O
authority O
, O
and O
properties O
granted O
to O
or O
used O
by O
a O
utility O
company.\u201d O
Respondent O
relies O
on O
the O
first O
clause. O
Under O
its O
language O
, O
the O
terms O
that O
define O
the O
scope O
of O
applicability O
of O
this O
exemption O
are O
\u201cdedicated O
to O
and O
accepted\u201d O
and O
\u201clocal O
public O
authority.\u201d O
Neither O
of O
these O
terms O
are O
defined O
in O
the O
declaration O
, O
and O
accordingly O
must O
be O
given O
their O
ordinary O
and O
accepted O
meanings. O
Respondents O
effort O
to O
bring O
IDOT\u2019s O
acquisition O
of O
these O
parcels O
under O
the O
section O
7 O
language O
fails O
both O
elements O
. O
First O
, O
\u201cdedicated O
to O
and O
accepted\u201d O
is O
clearly O
used O
in O
its O
real O
estate O
context. O
This O
is O
a O
standard O
real O
estate O
term O
denoting O
a O
particular O
method O
\u2014 O
or O
two O
methods O
, O
if O
both O
*395statutory O
and O
common O

an O
interest O

to O
a O
public O
body O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
a O
public O
way. O
In O
contemporary O
practice O
, O
this O

ordinarily O
, O
but O
not O
necessarily O
, O
for O
use O
as O
a O
public O
street O

Respondent O

no O

a O
usage O

\u201cdedicated\u201d O

a O

of O
interests O
in O

effected O
by O

, O
as O
was O
done O
here. O
Indeed O
, O
because O

ordinarily O
do O
not O
convey O
a O
fee O
but O
instead O
grant O
limited O
rights O
restricted O

the O

of O
the O

, O
most O
commonly O
the O
right O
of O
public O

there O
is O
ample O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
the O

use O
of O
the O
term O
\u201cdedicated\u201d O
(with O
its O
concomitant O
requirement O
of O
\u201cacceptance\u201d) O

an O

which O
land O
in O
the O
subdivision O
would O
be O
exempt O
from O
assessments O
. O
IDOT O
would O
have O
us O
read O
this O
expression O
to O
encompass O
any O
subdivision O
land O
as O
to O
which O
an O
interest O
was O
granted O
for O
road O
or O
highway O
purposes O
to O
any O
public O
entity. O
The O
declaration O
simply O
does O
not O
say O
that O
, O
although O
it O
readily O
could O
have O
if O
that O
were O
the O
intended O
purpose O
of O
this O
clause. O
We O
find O
no O
ambiguity O
in O
the O
language O
of O
section O
7 O
, O
nor O
any O
indication O
in O
the O
declaration O
of O
an O
intent O
comporting O
with O
Respondents O
broad O
interpretation O
. O
We O
find O
it O
much O
more O
likely O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
provision O
\u2014 O
which O
is O
common O
in O
developments O
involving O
common O
areas O
\u2014 O
was O
intended O
to O
accommodate O
possible O
dedications O
of O
internal O
streets O
and O
sidewalks O
to O
the O
local O
municipality O
or O
township O
, O
which O
would O
then O
maintain O
them. O
In O
such O
event O
, O
the O
section O
7 O
provision O
would O
exempt O
the O
dedicated O
portions O
of O
parcels O
from O
assessments O
as O
a O
way O
to O
equalize O
the O
assessment O
burden O
as O
between O
the O
owners O
of O
undedicated O
and O
partly-dedicated O
parcels. O
*396This O
purpose O
, O
of O
course O
, O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
major O
roads O
adjacent O
to O
the O
subdivision O
, O
or O
with O
tire O
use O
of O
eminent O
domain O
powers O
to O
acquire O
subdivision O
land O
, O
or O
with O
the O
removal O
from O
the O
residential O
subdivision O
of O
entire O
parcels O
as O
IDOTs O
road O
project O
would O
effect O
as O
a O
practical O
matter. O
There O
is O
no O
hint O
in O
the O
declaration O
that O
section O
7 O
was O
intended O
to O
address O
these O
issues O
, O
as O
Respondent O
itself O
acknowledges O
in O
its O
brief O
. O
Also O
supporting O
this O
view O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
operative O
effect O
of O
section O
7 O
is O
not O
to O
exclude O
the O
\u201cdedicated\u201d O
land O
(or O
the O
utility O
property O
covered O
by O
the O
other O
section O
7 O
clause) O
from O
the O
declaration O
or O
from O
the O
subdivision. O
Thus O
any O
land O
\u201cexempt\u201d O
under O
section O
7 O
remains O
subject O
to O
the O
other O
terms O
of O
the O
declaration O
, O
i.e. O
, O
other O
than O
tire O
assessment O
provisions. O
This O
suggests O
that O
section O
7 O
was O
intended O
to O
cover O
dedicated O
public O
streets O
and O
perhaps O
sidewalks O
inside O
the O
subdivision O
that O
serve O
the O
subdivision O
, O
not O
roads O
outside O
the O
subdivision O
, O
which O
would O
be O
the O
effective O
result O
here O
. O
Second O
, O
the O
term O
\u201clocal O
public O
authority\u201d O
is O
inconsistentrwith O
Respondents O
argument. O
Although O
neither O
party O
has O
cited O
us O
to O
any O
generally O
accepted O
meaning O
or O
usage O
of O
this O
term O
, O
it O
is O
apparent O
, O
as O
the O
association O
contends O
, O
that O
\u201clocal\u201d O
does O
not O
ordinarily O
connote O
a O
statewide O
agency O
or O
jurisdiction. O
Respondent\u2019s O
attempt O
to O
call O
IDOT O
a O
\u201clocal\u201d O
authority O
also O
fails O
to O
find O
support O
in O
the O
voluminous O
documentation O
that O
IDOT O
produces O
every O
year. O
As O
nearly O
as O
we O
can O
tell O
, O
IDOT O
does O
not O
refer O
to O
itself O
as O
a O
\u201clocal O
public O
authority\u201d O
or O
as O
\u201clocal.\u201d O
It O
is O
very O
difficult O
to O
see O
why O
a O
drafter O
of O
an O
Illinois O
subdivision O
declaration O
might O
do O
so O
. O
The O
literal O
and O
ordinary O
, O
but O
narrower O
, O
meaning O
of O
\u201cdedicated O
to O
# O
# O
local O
public O
authority\u201d O
is O
that O
this O
language O
covers O
dedications O
to O
local O
governments O
(usually O
for O
*397road O
or O
street O
purposes). O
In O
Illinois O
, O
as O
even O
a O
cursory O
review O
of O
our O
Highway O
Code O
shows O
, O
the O
\u201clocal\u201d O
authorities O
having O
street O
and O
road O
jurisdiction O
are O
cities O
, O
villages O
and O
incorporated O
towns O
(often O
referred O
to O
genetically O
as O
\u201cmunicipalities\u201d) O
, O
and O
townships O
and O
counties. O
Under O
the O
1970 O
Illinois O
Constitution O
, O
which O
was O
in O
effect O
when O
this O
declaration O
was O
written O
, O
local O
government O
includes O
those O
kinds O
of O
public O
bodies O
and O
\u201cspecial O
districts.\u201d O
See O
, O
1970 O
Ill. O
Const. O
, O
Art. O
VII O
, O
\u201cLocal O
Government.\u201d O
State O
agencies O
like O
IDOT O
are O
constitutionally O
and O
statutorily O
referred O
to O
by O
a O
number O
of O
expressions O
but O
never O
by O
one O
including O
the O
term O
\u201clocal.\u201d O
We O
can O
find O
no O
basis O
for O
concluding O
otherwise O
for O
the O
usage O
intended O
in O
this O
Illinois O
subdivision O
declaration O
. O
We O
therefore O
hold O
that O
the O
exemption O
in O
article O
4 O
, O
section O
7 O
of O
the O
declaration O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
these O
lots O
and O
does O
not O
exclude O
them O
or O
their O
owner O
from O
the O
covenant O
to O
pay O
assessments O
. O
2. O
Sovereign O
Immunity O
. O
The O
principal O
defense O
relied O
on O
by O
IDOT O
appears O
to O
be O
that O
sovereign O
immunity O
bars O
the O
enforcement O
of O
these O
covenants. O
There O
is O
an O
elegantly O
short O
answer O
to O
this: O
Sovereign O
immunity O
ceases O
at O
the O
door O
of O
this O
Court. O
Once O
a O
Claimant O
is O
successfully O
in O
this O
Court O
, O
sovereign O
immunity O
is O
statutorily O
waived O
and O
provides O
no O
defense O
against O
State O
liability O
as O
it O
does O
outside O
of O
this O
Court. O
See O
, O
An O
Act O
in O
relation O
to O
immunity O
for O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
, O
section O
1 O
(745 O
ILCS O
5/1); O
see O
also O
, O
Court O
of O
Claims O
Act O
, O
section O
8 O
(705 O
ILCS O
505/8). O
Sovereign O
immunity O
is O
not O
a O
defense O
to O
claims O
over O
which O
we O
have O
jurisdiction O
under O
our O
statute.4 O
It O
is O
a O
bit O
unsettling O
that O
a O
State O
agency O
like O
IDOT O
could O
so O
fundamentally O
misunderstand O
Illinois O
law O
of O
sovereign O
immunity O
. O
*398We O
might O
therefore O
consider O
the O
possibility O
that O
IDOT O
relies O
on O
a O
different O
concept O
than O
sovereign O
immunity. O
Respondent O
might O
be O
arguing O
that O
under O
common O
law O
, O
these O
kinds O
of O
subdivision O
covenants O
do O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
State O
or O
to O
government O
bodies O
generally. O
This O
kind O
of O
argument O
would O
not O
rely O
on O
immunity O
but O
on O
substantive O
real O
estate O
law. O
However O
, O
no O
common O
law O
precedent O
or O
statutory O
basis O
for O
such O
a O
rule O
of O
construction O
of O
covenants O
has O
been O
cited O
to O
us O
by O
Respondent O
, O
and O
we O
are O
unaware O
of O
any O
such O
principle O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
must O
reject O
both O
views O
of O
IDOTs O
defense. O
The O
covenants O
apply O
to O
IDOT O
as O
any O
other O
owner; O
the O
State O
is O
not O
immune O
in O
this O
Court O
to O
liability O
on O
these O
covenants O
. O
3. O
The O
Implied O
Contract O
Defense O
. O
Respondent O
contends O
that O
the O
declaration O
, O
and O
thus O
its O
covenants O
, O
are O
not O
express O
contracts O
, O
but O
are O
instead O
\u201cimplied O
contracts\u201d O
which O
are O
unenforceable O
against O
the O
State O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
based O
on O
long-settled O
precedents O
of O
this O
Court O
, O
e.g. O
, O
Brighton O
Building O
Maintenance O
Co. O
v. O
State O
(1982) O
, O
36 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
36. O
There O
is O
no O
need O
to O
review O
those O
precedents O
, O
which O
reject O
implied O
covenant O
claims O
(e.g. O
, O
quasi-contract O
, O
quantum O
meruit) O
in O
this O
Court O
, O
because O
the O
Claimant O
does O
not O
dispute O
that O
point O
of O
law O
. O
However O
, O
we O
must O
point O
out O
that O
the O
reason O
for O
this O
Courts O
rejection O
of O
implied-contract O
claims O
is O
jurisdictional O
, O
based O
on O
section O
8(b) O
of O
our O
Act O
\u2014 O
our O
contract O
jurisdiction O
clause O
\u2014 O
which O
limits O
the O
contract O
claim O
jurisdiction O
of O
this O
Court O
to O
\u201cclaims O
against O
the O
State O
founded O
upon O
any O
contract O
entered O
into O
with O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois.\u201d O
Recause O
implied O
contracts O
are O
not O
\u201cfounded O
upon\u201d O
express O
contracts O
they O
are O
not O
cognizable O
here O
. O
However O
, O
a O
claim O
based O
on O
a O
non-express O
contractual O
basis O
may O
nevertheless O
be O
cognizable O
in O
this O
Court. O
A O
*399third-party O
beneficiary O
claim O
\u2014 O
which O
itself O
is O
not O
an O
express O
contract O
\u2014 O
may O
be O
\u201cfounded O
upon\u201d O
another O
contract O
with O
the O
State O
that O
is O
an O
express O
contract. O
In O
that O
event O
jurisdiction O
lies O
here O
and O
the O
third-party O
beneficiary O
claim O
is O
cognizable. O

at O

. O
Like O
third-party O
beneficiary O
claims O
founded O
upon O
express O
contracts O
with O
the O
State O
, O
this O
contract O
claim O
founded O
upon O
a O
written O
express O
covenant O
is O
similarly O
not O
an O
\u201cimplied O
contract O
, O
\u201d O
and O
is O
therefore O
not O
outside O
our O
jurisdiction O
under O
section O
8(b) O
of O
our O
Act O
, O
at O
least O
not O
for O
that O
reason. O
This O
is O
clearly O
an O
express O
contract O
claim O
, O
not O
an O
implied O
contract O
claim O
. O
We O
must O
only O
complete O
the O
section O
8(b) O
jurisdictional O
analysis O
by O
determining O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
underlying O
express O
contract O
\u2014 O
here O
the O
subdivision O
covenants O
running O
with O
the O
purchased O
land O
\u2014 O
are O
indeed O
contracts O
\u201centered O
into O
with O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois\u201d O
so O
as O
to O
bring O
this O
claim O
under O
our O
jurisdiction. O
We O
find O
, O
without O
hesitation O
, O
that O
the O
States O
acquisition O
of O
title O
to O
the O
land O
subject O
to O
the O
duly O
recorded O
covenants O
and O
with O
actual O
notice O
of O
them O
made O
the O
State O
a O
party O
to O
the O
declaration O
and O
its O
subdivision O
covenants. O
Accordingly O
, O
this O
claim O
is O
a O
claim O
founded O
upon O
a O
contract O
with O
the O
State O
, O
and O
Respondents O
implied O
contract O
objection O
is O
rejected O
. O
3. O
The O
Benefits O
Argument O
. O
Respondent O
contends O
that O
the O
State O
is O
not O
, O
or O
should O
not O
be O
, O
obligated O
to O
pay O
association O
assessments O
because O
the O
State O
does O
not O
, O
and O
will O
not O
, O
receive O
any O
benefit O
from O
such O
payments. O
We O
do O
not O
understand O
the O
basis O
, O
in O
law O
or O
in O
the O
Constitution O
, O
for O
this O
argument O
, O
and O
no O
supporting O
basis O
or O
precedent O
has O
been O
cited O
to O
us O
. O
This O
argument O
may O
have O
been O
intended O
as O
an O
adjunct O
to O
Respondents O
\u201cimplied O
contract\u201d O
theory O
, O
i.e. O
, O
that O
*400if O
the O
associations O
claim O
were O
to O
be O
adjudicated O
as O
an O
implied O
contract O
, O
then O
the O
benefits O
analysis O
would O
be O
a O
proper O
defense O
to O
such O
a O
theory. O
However O
, O
neither O
Claimant O
nor O
this O
Court O
has O
considered O
this O
claim O
to O
be O
based O
on O
implied O
contract O
doctrines O
. O
In O
any O
event O
, O
the O
Respondents O
benefit O
analysis O
, O
considered O
as O
an O
independent O
defense O
to O
the O
Claimants O
express O
contract O
claim O
, O
must O
be O
rejected O
as O
baseless O
. O
4. O
The O
Illinois O
Purchasing O
Act O
The O
Respondent O
contends O
that O
the O
assessment O
covenant O
is O
unenforceable O
against O
the O
State O
because O
its O
acquisition O
was O
not O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
Illinois O
Purchasing O
Act O
(30 O
ILCS O
505/9.01 O
et O
seq.) O
, O
which O
generally O
governs O
State O
purchases O
and O
contracts O
for O
goods O
and O
services. O
Respondent O
characterizes O
the O
contract O
in O
this O
case O
as O
a O
\u201ccontract O
for O
services\u201d O
between O
the O
association O
and O
IDOT O
, O
and O
argues O
that O
as O
such O
it O
violates O
the O
Purchasing O
Act\u2019s O
requirements O
that O
such O
contracts O
be O
reduced O
to O
writing O
and O
filed O
with O
the O
State O
Comptroller O
. O
This O
clever O
argument O
cannot O
be O
taken O
too O
seriously O
, O
for O
the O
simple O
reason O
that O
the O
\u201cservices O
contract\u201d O
hypothecated O
after-the-fact O
by O
the O
Respondent O
is O
not O
a O
separate O
and O
independent O
contract. O
Simply O
put O
, O
there O
is O
no O
independent O
\u201ccontract O
for O
services\u201d O
in O
this O
case O
that O
might O
be O
bid O
, O
or O
exempted O
and O
negotiated O
, O
or O
filed O
with O
the O
Comptroller. O
The O
contract O
in O
this O
case O
is O
the O
declaration O
, O
which O
contains O
as O
an O
integral O
and O
unseverable O
part O
the O
covenants O
that O
Respondent O
now O
seeks O
, O
erroneously O
, O
to O
treat O
as O
an O
independent O
contract O
. O
The O
State\u2019s O
entry O
into O
that O
contract O
was O
an O
implicit O
part O
of O
its O
purchase O
of O
the O
four O
subdivision O
lots. O
Thus O
, O
if O
there O
were O
to O
be O
a O
violation O
of O
the O
Purchasing O
Act O
, O
the O
applicability O
and O
requirements O
of O
the O
Act O
as O
applied O
to O
this O
*401land O
acquisition O
must O
be O
analyzed. O
That O
is O
a O
separate O
question O
from O
the O
point O
advanced O
by O
Respondent. O
However O
, O
neither O
party O
claims O
that O
IDOT\u2019s O
purchase O
of O
land O
for O
highway O
purposes O
is O
governed O
by O
the O
Purchasing O
Act O
or O
that O
the O
purchase O
under O
threat O
of O
condemnation O
in O
this O
case O
somehow O
violated O
that O
Act. O
This O
is O
understandable. O
In O
this O
light O
, O
we O
need O
not O
further O
examine O
that O
issue O
. O
5. O
Attorney\u2019s O
Fees O
and O
Interest O
. O
Respondent O
argues O
that O
the O
State O
is O
not O
liable O
for O
attorney\u2019s O
fees O
or O
interest O
absent O
a O
statute O
so O
providing O
which O
is O
missing O
here. O
Claimant O
urges O
, O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
that O
its O
claims O
for O
attorney\u2019s O
fees O
and O
interest O
are O
not O
predicated O
on O
statute O
or O
Court O
rule O
or O
common O
law O
, O
but O
are O
instead O
contractual O
obligations O
under O
the O
declaration O
(article O
9 O
, O
section O
3) O
, O
which O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
are O
as O
enforceable O
as O
the O
remainder O
of O
the O
declaration O
against O
a O
subdivision O
lot O
owner O
. O
Claimants O
recovery O
of O
these O
components O
of O
its O
damages O
claim O
rests O
on O
the O
enforceability O
of O
the O
covenant O
providing O
for O
payment O
of O
attorneys\u2019 O
fees O
, O
collection O
costs O
and O
interest. O
Respondent O
has O
cited O
no O
precedent O

Conservation O
(1977) O
, O
32 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
113 O
, O
114-115 O
, O
this O
Court O
allowed O
recovery O
of O
attorney\u2019s O
fees O
from O
the O
State O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
contract O
damages O
, O
where O
the O
contract O
expressly O
provides O
for O
them O
and O
where O
the O
attorney O
fees O
were O
a O
result O
of O
the O
Respondent\u2019s O
breach O
of O

, O
are O
in O
the O
nature O
of O

incurred O
as O
a O
result O
of O

Given O
the O
precedent O
of O
Douglas O
, O
and O
the O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
this O
kind O
of O
collection O
expense O
is O
directly O
caused O
by O
IDOT\u2019s O
refusal O
to O
pay O
these O
assessments O
, O
we O
perceive O
no O
reason O

these O
contractual O

should O
not O
be O
treated O
as O
any O
other O
contract O

Supporting O
Appropriations O
. O
The O
Respondents O
final O
defense O
against O
payment O
to O
the O
association O
is O
its O
contention O
that O
even O
if O
the O
subdivision O
covenants O
are O
binding O
on O
the O
State O
, O
no O
money O
judgment O
may O
be O
imposed O
by O
this O
Court O
against O
the O
State O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
an O
appropriation O
for O
the O
particular O
contractual O
purpose. O
On O
this O
point O
, O
finally O
, O
we O
find O
principled O
agreement O
with O
the O
State O
in O
this O
case O
. O
For O
its O
part O
, O
the O
Claimant O
does O
not O
dispute O
this O
appropriations O
principle O
, O
but O
instead O
advances O
two O
points O
that O
, O
if O
accepted O
, O
would O
satisfy O
the O
appropriations O
requirement. O
First O
, O
Claimant O
argues O
that O
the O
Respondents O
view O
of O
what O
is O
a O
proper O
appropriation O
to O
fund O
or O
to O
support O
payment O
of O
these O
association O
assessments O
is O
excessively O
stringent. O
Second O
, O
Claimant O
contends O
that O
in O
the O
annual O
appropriations O
to O
IDOT O
for O
fiscal O
years O
1992-1994 O
, O
covering O
the O
periods O
for O
which O
assessment O
payments O
are O
sought O
in O
the O
Claimants O
motion O
, O
there O
were O
in O
fact O
adequate O
appropriations O
to O
make O
these O
payments O
and O
that O
sufficient O
funds O
lapsed O
from O
those O
appropriations O
in O
those O
years O
to O
allow O
an O
award O
for O
the O
amounts O
now O
sought O
. O
We O
observe O
that O
IDOT O
has O
not O
seriously O
challenged O
these O
appropriations O
contentions O
of O
the O
Claimant. O
However O
, O
the O
requirement O
for O
appropriations O
to O
support O
State O
contractual O
obligations O
is O
a O
requirement O
of O
constitutional O
dimensions O
, O
and O
this O
Court O
must O
exercise O
its O
own O
scrutiny O
on O
this O
issue O
, O
rather O
than O
merely O
side O
with O
the O
superior O
argument. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
have O
reviewed O
the O
IDOT O
appropriations O
act O
submitted O
by O
Claimant O
for O
the O
subject O
years O
. O
The O
Court O
concludes O
that O
appropriations O
for O
land O
acquisition O
, O
for O
maintenance O
of O
property O
, O
and O
for O
some O
contractual O
service O
line O
items O
are O
adequate O
, O
consistent O
with O
the O
State O
Finance O
Act O
, O
to O
support O
expenditures O
for O
these O
*403subdivision O
assessments O
which O
, O
on O
this O
record O
, O
are O
for O
maintenance O
of O
property O
owned O
by O
IDOT. O
We O
are O
also O
persuaded O
that O
Claimant O
is O
correct O
that O
sufficient O
funds O
lapsed O
in O
these O
years O
from O
suitable O
line O
items O
to O
support O
an O
award O
in O
this O
case O
. O
Count O
II: O
Foreclosure O
of O
the O
Associations O
Lien O
In O
count O
II O
, O
the O
association O
seeks O
to O
foreclose O
its O
hen O
under O
the O
declaration O
on O
the O
four O
subdivision O
lots O
, O
and O
thus O
to O
foreclose O
on O
IDOTs O
title O
to O
those O
properties O
, O
in O
order O
to O
recover O
the O
unpaid O
assessments O
that O
are O
, O
also O
, O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
count O
I O
contract O
claim. O
The O
Respondent O
has O
interposed O
a O
number O
of O
legal O
and O
jurisdictional O
defenses O
to O
the O
count O
II O
foreclosure O
action O
. O
However O
, O
in O
light O
of O
our O
summary O
judgment O
on O
count O
I O
and O
our O
determination O
to O
make O
an O
award O
, O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
count O
II O
foreclosure O
action O
is O
now O
moot O
, O
at O
least O
for O
the O
present. O
We O
therefore O
need O
not O
take O
up O
the O
technical O
issues O
involved O
in O
the O
litigation O
of O
count O
II O
, O
and O
will O
dismiss O
count O
II O
without O
prejudice O
to O
renew O
it O
if O
for O
any O
reason O
the O
assessed O
payments O
awarded O
herein O
are O
not O
paid O
, O
or O
for O
other O
good O
cause O
. O
Conclusion O
and O
Order O
The O
subdivision O
covenants O
are O
contractual O
obligations O
that O
run O
with O
the O
land O
, O
and O
bind O
all O
owners O
, O
including O
the O
State. O
As O
contractual O
covenants O
running O
with O
and O
benefiting O
and O
burdening O
these O
lands O
, O
they O
take O
on O
the O
character O
of O
interests O
in O
land. O
IDOT O
acquired O
the O
four O
lots O
but O
did O
not O
acquire O
the O
association\u2019s O
interest O
in O
the O
lots O
, O
as O
it O
plainly O
ought O
to O
have O
done O
, O
and O
thus O
its O
quitclaim O
deed O
brought O
less O
than O
might O
have O
been O
prudently O
expected. O
We O
have O
held O
that O
IDOT O
is O
subject O
to O
the O
covenant O
rights O
against O
those O
lots. O
But O
that O
will O
not O
end O
this O
matter O
. O
*404Unfortunately O
, O
those O
covenants O
will O
continue O
to O
impose O
at O
least O
an O
annual O
obligation O
on O
the O
State O
, O
and O
possibly O
more O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
availability O
of O
appropriated O
funds. O
We O
take O
the O
unusual O
step O
of O
pointing O
this O
out O
because O
of O
the O
obvious O
, O
but O
serious O
, O
concern O
that O
this O
case O
will O
return O
on O
an O
annual O
basis O
until O
either O
the O
State O
conveys O
away O
these O
lots O
or O
effects O
a O
settlement O
with O
the O
association O
or O
acquires O
the O
associations O
interests O
in O
the O
covenants O
on O
these O
lots O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
it O
is O
ordered: O
A. O
The O

E. O
Count O

of O
the O

dismissed O
without O
prejudice O
. O
The O
association O
is O
a O
not-for-profit O
corporation O
as O
the O
declaration O
mandates O
. O
The O
declaration O
also O
contains O
restrictions O
which O
, O
if O
enforceable O
against O
IDOT O
, O
would O
effectively O
preclude O
the O
use O
of O
the O
four O
lots O
for O
the O
highway O
purposes O
for O
which O
IDOT O
acquired O
them. O
Insofar O
as O
the O
record O
on O
summary O
judgment O
reflects O
, O
the O
four O
parcels O
have O
remained O
vacant O
and O
have O
not O
been O
utilized O
for O
any O
purpose O
by O
IDOT O
to O
date O
. O
The O
declaration O
was O
noted O
as O
a O
special O
exception O
in O
the O
second O
title O
commitment O
obtained O
by O
IDOT O
(see O

on O

the O
statute O
was O
not O
intended O
to O
, O
and O
does O
not O
, O
have O
universal O
application. O
Still O
, O
we O
agree O
with O
the O
Respondent O
and O
adhere O
*427to O
our O
existing O
construction O
that O
where O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113(g) O
applies O
, O
it O
is O
absolute O
in O
the O
immunity O
granted O
to O
IDOT. O
(Village O
of O
Lansing O
, O
supra.) O
Nevertheless O
, O
this O
statute O
is O
contrary O
to O
the O
common O
law O
of O
tort O
liability O
(sovereign O
immunity O
aside) O
, O
and O
is O
thus O
to O
be O
construed O
narrowly O
where O
possible O
in O
light O
of O
its O
language. O
Since O
the O
language O
here O
does O
not O
define O
the O
scope O
of O
applicability O
, O
we O
look O
to O
the O
statutory O
context O
, O
i.e. O
, O
the O
Act O
and O
the O
section O
containing O
this O
paragraph O
, O
for O
an O
elucidation O
of O
the O
legislative O
intent O
of O
the O
applicability O
of O
this O
provision O
. O
The O
Court O
need O
not O
here O
identify O
a O
bright O
line O
of O
applicability O
for O
this O
statutory O
immunity O
provision: O
it O
suffices O
for O
present O
purposes O
to O
observe O
that O
its O
applicability O
cannot O
sensibly O
be O
broader O
than O
the O
Act O
of O
which O
it O
is O
a O
part O
, O
the O
Highway O
Code. O
(Indeed O
, O
when O
this O
provision O
was O
enacted O
as O
part O
of O
the O
original O
Highway O
Code O
, O
the O
1870 O
Constitution O
contained O
a O
restriction O
in O
its O
legislative O
article O
limiting O
the O
contents O
of O
legislation O
to O
the O
\u201csubject\u201d O
of O
the O
enactment. O
See O
1870 O
Ill. O
Const. O
, O
art. O
IV O
, O
section O
13 O
(single O
subject O
rule). O
Thus O
tire O
impact O
of O
this O
provision O
could O
not O
exceed O
the O
\u201chighway\u201d O
subject O
of O
the O
code.) O
Similarly O
, O
there O
is O
no O
basis O
for O
reading O
this O
immunity O
provision O
any O
broader O
than O
the O
subject O
of O
the O
section O
of O
which O
it O
is O
a O
part. O
The O
draftsmanship O
of O
this O
statute O
\u2014 O
which O
placed O
this O
immunity O
clause O
within O
a O
larger O
section O
, O
rather O
than O
establishing O
it O
as O
a O
free-standing O
provision O
within O
the O
code O
\u2014 O
suggests O
that O
it O
is O
but O
an O
aspect O
of O
the O
subject O
addressed O
in O
section O
9\u2014 O
113 O
, O
rather O
than O
having O
more O
general O
application O
. O
When O
the O
scope O
of O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113 O
is O
reviewed O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
this O
section O
is O
solely O
concerned O
with O
the O
sharing O
of O
State O
and O
township O
highway O
right-of-ways O
with O
other O
users O
under O
a O
permit O
system O
administered O
by O
IDOT. O
Simply O
put O
, O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113 O
creates O
a O
regulatory O
or O
permit O
system O
for O
the O
use O
of O
State O
and O
township O
real O
estate O
by O
local O
*428governments O
, O
public O
utilities O
, O
and O
purely O
private O
parties; O
it O
is O
a O
land O
use O
statute. O
The O
immunity O
and O
liability-shifting O
provisions O
of O
paragraph O
(e) O
are O
plainly O
designed O
to O
eliminate O
the O
States O
responsibility O
for O
the O
gratuitous O
use O
of O
its O
property O
under O
this O
land O
use O
statute O
. O
In O
this O
context O
, O
it O
follows O
that O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113(g) O
has O
no O
intended O
application O
beyond O
the O
landuser-landowner O
liabilities O
implicated O
by O
the O
statutory O
land O
use O
scheme O
of O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113. O
This O
, O
then O
, O
is O
the O
consideration O
that O
determines O
the O
outer O
limits O
of O
the O
application O
of O
section O
9\u2014 O
113(g) O
immunity O
. O
Where O
the O
liability O
asserted O
against O
IDOT O
relates O
to O
, O
or O
arises O
out O
of O
, O
the O
ownership O
, O
operation O
, O
maintenance O
or O
use O
of O
the O
highway O
or O
roadway O
right-of-way O
, O
then O
the O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113(g) O
immunity O
applies O
full O
force O
and O
unqualifiedly. O
Where O
the O
asserted O
liability O
of O
IDOT O
arises O
independently O
of O
, O
and O
unrelated O
to O
, O
the O
ownership O
, O
operation O
, O
maintenance O
or O
use O
of O
the O
right-of-way O
, O
then O
that O
liability O
is O
beyond O
the O
read O
of O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113(g) O
immunity. O
The O
inquiry O
is O
necessarily O
a O
case-by-case O
and O
fact-dependent O
exercise O
. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
liability O
asserted O
arises O
from O
the O
allegedly O
negligent O
operation O
of O
mowing O
equipment O
by O
IDOT O
personnel O
on O
the O
highway. O
The O
IDOT O
activity O
involved O
was O
the O
mowing O
of O
the O
highway O
right-of-way O
, O
which O
is O
clearly O
related O
to O
\u2014 O
and O
virtually O
a O
part O
of\u2014 O
IDOT\u2019s O
ownership O
and O
maintenance O
of O
the O
highway O
right-of-way. O
Indeed O
, O
this O
kind O
of O
normal O
maintenance O
activity O
is O
precisely O
the O
kind O
of O
activity O
that O
was O
plainly O
intended O
to O
be O
immunized O
against O
liability O
to O
those O
using O
the O
property O
under O
permit O
. O
Thus O
we O
find O
, O
as O
we O
must O
, O
that O
the O
village\u2019s O
claim O
predicated O
on O
the O
allegedly O
negligent O
mowing O
operation O
*429is O
barred O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
by O
section O
9 O
\u2014 O
113(g). O
For O
this O
reason O
, O
the O
Respondents O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
must O
be O
granted O
. O
The O
claim O
is O
dismissed O
with O
prejudice O
. O

The O
Claimant O
, O
Mark O
Alsobrook O
, O
filed O
this O
claim O
as O
a O
result O
of O
a O
motorcycle O
accident O
which O
occurred O
on O
July O
14 O
, O
1988. O
Mr. O
Alsobrook O
had O
been O
riding O
motorcycles O
for O
15 O
years. O
He O
had O
purchased O
a O
1980 O
Suzuki O
approximately O
four O
months O
before O
the O
accident. O
The O
accident O
occurred O
at O
8:00 O
p.m. O
on O
Interstate O
290 O
, O
approximately O
one-half O
mile O
north O
of O
Biesterfield O
Road. O
He O
and O
a O
friend O
of O
his O
, O
Steve O
Widdle O
, O
were O
both O
headed O
south O
on O
Interstate O
290 O
. O
At O
that O
location O
, O
there O
were O
three O
lanes O
of O
southbound O
traffic. O
Widdle O
was O
riding O
ahead O
of O
Alsobrook O
and O
was O
on O
the O
in-ramp O
to O
get O
onto O
the O
interstate. O
There O
was O
a O
slow-moving O
car O
on O
the O
ramp O
ahead O
of O
Widdle. O
Widdle O
and O
Alsobrook O
changed O
lanes O
to O
pass O
this O
car O
and O
then O
moved O
from O
the O
far O
right-hand O
lane O
to O
the O
middle O
lane. O
This O
took O
one O
to O
two O
seconds. O
Alsobrook O
described O
the O
roadway O
at O
this O
point O
as O
\u201crough.\u201d O
As O
Alsobrook O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
lane O
behind O
Widdle O
, O
he O
struck O
a O
rut O
and O
lost O
control O
of O
his O
motorcycle. O
Widdle O
s O
motorcycle O
at O
the O
time O
was O
30 O
to O
80 O
feet O
in O
front O
of O
Alsobrook O
, O
but O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
the O
lane. O
Alsobrook O
states O
that O
he O
was O
doing O
55 O
mph O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
accident O
. O
Alsobrook O
stated O
that O
he O
struck O
the O
ruts O
one O
second O
after O
seeing O
them. O
His O
motorcycle O
traveled O
50 O
to O
80 O
feet O
during O
that O
time. O
He O
could O
not O
turn O
left O
because O
of O
traffic. O
He O
stated O
that O
the O
first O
rut O
grabbed O
the O
front O
tire O
and O
yanked O
it O
to O
the O
left. O
The O
second O
rut O
yanked O
the O
motorcycle O
out O
of O
his O
hand. O
Alsobrook O
submitted O
photographs O
of O
the O
area O
which O
show O
extremely O
long O
and O
narrow O
broken O
concrete O
with O
some O
degree O
of O
ruts. O
These O
photographs O
were O
taken O
three O
weeks O
after O
the O
accident O
while O
Also-brook O
was O
present O
. O
*207A O
State O
trooper O
, O
Officer O
Wagner O
, O
was O
called O
as O
a O
witness O
by O
Alsobrook. O
He O
testified O
that O
the O
pavement O
was O
separated O
by O
a O
dropoff O
of O
one O
to O
two O
inches. O
He O
further O
testified O
that O
a O
scruff O
mark O
originated O
in O
the O
lane O
closest O
to O
the O
median O
and O
traveled O
approximately O
100 O
feet O
to O
where O
the O
motorcycle O
came O
to O
rest. O
The O
trooper O
stated O
that O
a O
scruff O
mark O
is O
a O
tire O
mark O
made O
by O
a O
tire O
rolling O
sideways O
as O
opposed O
to O
skid O
mark O
caused O
by O
braking O
action O
. O
Widdle O
testified O
for O
Alsobrook. O
He O
testified O
that O
he O
was O
riding O
his O
motorcycle O
in O
front O
of O
Alsobrook O
at O
a O
speed O
of O
55 O
mph. O
He O
testified O
that O
Alsobrook O
hit O
the O
rut O
in O
the O
center O
lane O
, O
and O
that O
Alsobrooks O
pictures O
were O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
the O
rut O
that O
he O
hit. O
Widdle O
further O
testified O
that O
Alsobrook O
was O
50 O
to O
100 O
feet O
behind O
him O
, O
and O
he O
went O
over O
the O
handlebars O
after O
the O
motorcycle O
went O
sideways. O
He O
stated O
that O
Alsobrook O
ended O
up O
on O
the O
shoulder O
of O
the O
road O
. O
It O
appears O
that O
the O
Claimant O
has O
proved O
by O
a O
preponderance O
of O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
ruts O
identified O
in O
the O
photographs O
were O
indeed O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
accident O
in O
question. O
They O
were O
both O
the O
actual O
cause O
and O
the O
proximate O
cause. O
The O
State O
obviously O
has O
no O
duty O
to O
be O
an O
insurer O
of O
its O
highways O
, O
but O
does O
have O
a O
duty O
to O
keep O
the O
highways O
reasonably O
safe O
for O
the O
purposes O
for O
which O
they O
were O
intended. O
These O
purposes O
include O
the O
riding O
of O
motorcycles O
. O
The O
Claimant O
, O
however O
, O
must O
prove O
either O
actual O
or O
constructive O
notice O
of O
the O
defect O
by O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
in O
order O
to O
be O
able O
to O
recover. O
(Berger O
v. O
State O
(1988) O
, O
40 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
120.) O
Actual O
notice O
has O
not O
been O
proven O
. O
Constructive O
notice O
, O
therefore O
, O
is O
the O
ultimate O
issue O
in O
this O
case O
, O
as O
it O
is O
in O
many O
highway O
defect O
cases. O
It O
always O
creates O
a O
difficult O
burden O
for O
a O
Claimant O
to O
meet. O
Unlike O
weather-related O
cases O
, O
it O
is O
difficult O
to O
prove O
by O
circumstantial O
evidence O
that O
the O
State O
indeed O
had O
notice O
of O
the O
defect O
. O
*208The O
two O
general O
methods O
for O
proving O
constructive O
notice O
of O
a O
defect O
are O
the O
length O
of O
time O
that O
the O
defect O
has O
existed O
and/or O
the O
defect O
being O
so O
obvious O
that O
constructive O
notice O
could O
be O
imputed O
by O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
defect O
itself O
. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
based O
on O
the O
facts O
presented O
, O
this O
is O
a O
veiy O
close O
question. O
It O
was O
impossible O
for O
the O
Claimant O
to O
prove O
the O
length O
of O
time O
that O
the O
defect O
existed O
due O
to O
the O
lack O
of O
records O
available O
to O
him O
with O
which O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
weather-related O
defect O
. O
We O
therefore O
turn O
to O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
defect O
in O
question. O
Widdle O
s O
testimony O
confirms O
Alsobrook\u2019s O
testimony O
that O
the O
photographs O
accurately O
depict O
the O
ruts O
which O
caused O
the O
accident. O
The O
State O
has O
produced O
no O
evidence O
to O
directly O
contradict O
this. O
A O
close O
review O
of O
the O
ruts O
in O
question O
indicate O
from O
the O
nature O
and O
extent O
of O
the O
rut O
, O
that O
we O
can O
impute O
constructive O
notice O
of O
the O
rut O
in O
question O
to O
the O
State. O
While O
it O
is O
possible O
, O
and O
probably O
likely O
that O
large O
trucks O
do O
cause O
traumatic O
potholes O
by O
striking O
patches O
in O
the O
pavement O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
unlikely O
that O
the O
long O
, O
narrow O
defects O
in O
the O
concrete O
in O
this O
case O
were O
caused O
by O
one O
or O
two O
vehicles O
over O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
find O
that O
the O
State O
had O
constructive O
notice O
of O
this O
particular O
defect. O
If O
this O
defect O
were O
significantly O
different O
, O
or O
even O
moderately O
different O
, O
then O
we O
might O
, O
and O
probably O
would O
, O
reach O
a O
different O
result O
. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
injuiy O
, O
Alsobrook O
was O
seriously O
injured. O
His O
total O
medical O
bills O
were O
$15 O
, O
200 O
, O
and O
he O
had O
lost O
wages O
of O
$4 O
, O
680. O
In O
addition O
, O
the O
evidence O
was O
uncontradicted O
that O
Alsobrook O
suffered O
significant O
pain O
and O
suffering O
, O
scarring O
, O
short O
term O
memory O
loss O
, O
and O
restrictions O
as O
to O
his O
physical O
abilities O
which O
he O
did O
not O
have O
prior O
to O
the O
accident O
. O
*209There O
was O
no O
direct O
evidence O
presented O
to O
the O
Court O
of O
contributory O
or O
comparative O
fault; O
however O
, O
the O
Court O
has O
carefully O
reviewed O
the O
testimony O
of O
Alsobrook O
as O
to O
his O
actions O
immediately O
prior O
to O
leaving O
the O
motorcycle. O
We O
believe O
there O
is O
some O
degree O
of O
comparative O
fault O
. O
We O
find O
liability O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
Respondent O
and O
establish O
damages O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
one O
hundred O
twenty-five O
thousand O
dollars O
($125 O
, O
000). O
We O
find O
Alsobrook O
to O
be O
forty O
percent O
(40%) O
at O
fault O
, O
and O
we O
reduce O
the O
damages O
by O
fifty O
thousand O
dollars O
($50 O
, O
000) O
and O
award O
the O
Claimant O
the O
amount O
of O
seventy-five O
thousand O
dollars O

Claimants O

complaint O
in O
this O

in O
a O
timely O
fashion. O
On O
October O

1993 O
, O
the O
Court O
entered O
a O
default O
judgment O
against O

a O

twenty-five O
thousand O

That O
joint O
stipulation O
was O
rejected O
by O
the O
Court O
on O
September O
30 O
, O
1994 O
, O
because O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
or O
information O
to O
indicate O
how O
the O
settlement O
figure O
was O
reached O
, O
how O
the O

, O
or O
whether O
there O
was O
any O
basis O

Claimants O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O

Accordingly O

was O
adduced O
. O
Dr. O

medicine O
, O
testified O
that O
he O
examined O

, O
1986. O
Dr. O
Kern O
indicated O
that O
Donna O
Hills O
died O
from O

in O
a O
bathtub O
on O
that O
date. O
According O
to O
Dr. O
Kern O
, O
before O
Ms. O
Hills O
died O
she O
had O
some O
pain O
and O
*186suffering O
even O
though O
she O
was O
profoundly O
mentally O
retarded O
because O
she O
was O
still O
able O
to O
feel. O
Specifically O
, O
Dr. O
Kern O
indicated O
that O
Claimants\u2019 O
decedent O
would O
have O
been O
gasping O
for O
breath O
and O
able O
to O
see O
out O
of O
the O
bathtub. O
However O
, O
she O
would O
not O
have O
been O
able O
to O
integrate O
the O
necessary O
information O
in O
order O
to O
get O
out O
of O
the O
tub O
and O
save O
herself. O
According O
to O
Dr. O
Kern O
, O
the O
pain O
would O
have O
lasted O
five O
to O
ten O
minutes O
before O
Donna O
Hills O
lost O
consciousness O
. O
Betty O
Hightower O
, O
the O
mother O
of O
Donna O
Hills O
, O
testified O
that O
Donna O
became O
mentally O
retarded O
at O
the O
age O
of O
three O
and O
a O
half O
years O
old. O
Before O
that O
time O
she O
was O
a O
\u201cnormal O
little O
girl O
, O
playful O
and O
cheerful.\u201d O
After O
Donna O
became O
mentally O
retarded O
, O
Ms. O
Hightower O
and O
her O
family O
continued O
to O
care O
for O
her O
at O
home O
for O
six O
and O
a O
half O
years O
, O
from O
approximately O
1967 O
to O
1974. O
Since O
Donna O
was O
profoundly O
mentally O
retarded O
, O
she O
required O
involved O
, O
100% O
care O
, O
including O
taking O

, O
washing O
her O
, O
dressing O
her O
, O
feeding O
her O
, O
and O

Claimants O
Michael O
Miller O
, O
Vincent O
Hills O
, O
Jr. O
, O
and O
Troy O
Hills O
. O
In O
1974 O
, O
Donna O
was O
placed O
in O
a O
State O
home O
because O
her O
seizures O
had O
increased O
and O
the O
family O
could O
no O
longer O
take O
care O
of O
her O
at O
home. O
Donna O
was O
first O
placed O
at O
Reed O
for O
approximately O
five O
months. O
Ms. O
Hightower O
visited O
Donna O
three O
times O
during O
the O
time O
Donna O
was O
at O
Reed O
. O
After O
Donna O
left O
Reed O
, O
she O
was O
placed O
at O
Dixon O
for O
five O
years. O
Ms. O
Hightower O
would O
visit O
Donna O
about O
every O
four O
months. O
She O
could O
not O
visit O
more O
often O
because O
she O
did O
not O
own O
a O
car. O
While O
Ms. O
Hightower O
requested O
that O
Donna O
come O
home O
on O
visits O
, O
she O
was O
advised O
that O
it O
was O
too O
far O
for O
her O
to O
come O
on O
the O
train. O
Ms. O
Hightower O
would O
call O
the O
staff O
at O
Dixon O
to O
inquire O
about O
Donna O
on O
a O
regular O
basis. O
Since O
Donna O
could O
not O
speak O
, O
she O
did O
not O
speak O
to O
*187her O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
arrangements O
at O
Dixon O
, O
Donna O
was O
not O
able O
to O
hear O
Ms. O
Hightowers O
voice O
on O
the O
telephone O
. O
Ms. O
Hightower O
was O
not O
satisfied O
with O
the O
care O
and O
treatment O
Donna O
was O
receiving O
at O
Dixon O
and O
therefore O
she O
asked O
for O
Donna\u2019s O
transfer. O
Donna O
was O
subsequently O
transferred O
to O
the O
Ludeman O
Center O
in O
1979. O
The O
Ludeman O

was O
closer O
to O
Ms. O
Hightower\u2019s O
residence. O
While O
Donna O
was O
at O
Ludeman O
, O
Ms. O
Hightower O
would O
bring O
Donna O
home O
for O
two O
to O
three O
week O
intervals O
about O
every O
four O
months. O
In O
addition O
, O
Ms. O
Hightower O
and O
her O
children O
would O
visit O
Donna O
at O
Ludeman O
and O
would O
call O
Donna O
so O
she O
could O
hear O
their O
voices. O
According O
to O
Ms. O
Hightower O
, O
she O
was O
planning O
on O
bringing O
Donna O
home O
to O
live O
with O
her O
. O
Also O
, O
according O
to O
Ms. O
Hightower O
, O
Donna O
knew O
her O
and O
was O
happy O
when O
she O
came O
to O
visit. O
When O
they O
were O
together O
, O
they O
would O
hug O
and O
rock. O
Donna O
would O
be O
sad O
when O
Ms. O
Hightower O
left O
. O
Ms. O
Hightower O
learned O
that O
Donna O
was O
dead O
after O
she O
received O
a O
call O
and O
went O
to O
the O
hospital. O
When O
she O
learned O
how O
Donna O
had O
died O
, O
she O
felt O
hurt O
and O
betrayed. O
Ms. O
Hightower O
loved O
Donna O
and O
misses O
her. O
She O
thinks O
about O
Donna O
all O
of O
the O
time O

with O
the O
day-to-day O
activities O
(including O
washing O
and O
feeding O
Donna) O
to O
the O
best O
of O
her O
ability. O
She O
also O
played O
with O
Donna. O
Troy O
was O
also O
the O
only O
one O
Donna O
would O
let O
fix O
her O
hair. O
When O
other O
people O
tried O
, O
Donna O
would O
cry O
or O
throw O
a O
tantrum O
. O
After O
Donna O
was O
institutionalized O
, O
Troy O
would O
visit O
her O
several O
times O
a O

Also O
, O
when O

for O
Donna. O
While O

Donna O
could O
hear O
her O
voice. O
Troy O
loved O
her O
sister O
and O
misses O
her. O
Troy O
named O
her O
own O
daughter O
Donna O

after O
her O

name. O
Troy O
still O

Michael O
Miller O
is O
Donnas O
older O
brother. O
He O
was O
nine O
years O
of O

Michael O
lived O
at O
home O
with O
Donna O
until O
1972 O
when O
he O
left O

During O
the O

at O
a O
time O
when O
Donna O
was O
home O

During O
that O

take O
care O
of O
Donna. O
Donna O
recognized O
him O
when O
he O
came O
to O
visit O
and O
would O
be O
happy. O
The O
fact O
that O
Donna O
was O
mentally O
retarded O
encouraged O
him O
to O
obtain O
a O
bachelors O
degree O
in O
social O
work. O
When O
Michael O
found O
out O
his O
sister O

he O
was O
\u201cangry O
, O
hurt O
and O

Michael O

He O

has O
been O
overprotective O

. O
Donnas O
funeral O
cost O
one O
thousand O
seven O
hundred O
eighty-four O
dollars O
($1 O

784). O
According O
to O
standard O
mortality O
*189tables O
, O
the O
deceased O
and O
the O
Claimants O
had O
more O
than O
30 O
years O
left O
in O
which O
to O
enjoy O
each O
others O
companionship O
at O
the O
time O
of O
Donna\u2019s O

In O

However O
, O
Respondent O
disputes O
Claimants\u2019 O
request O
for O
the O
maximum O
amount O
of O

by O
arguing O
that O
all O
instances O
of O

It O

the O
sum O
of O

eighty-four O
dollars O
($26 O
, O
784) O
for O
pain O
and O
suffering O
and O
funeral O
expenses. O
The O

endured O
between O

suffering O
and O
had O
a O

The O
Claimant O
, O
Thos. O
J. O
Madden O
Co. O
(\u201cMadden\u201d) O
, O
was O
hired O
by O
IDOT O
to O
build O
a O
new O
bridge O
over O
an O
old O
creek. O
The O
construction O
required O
diversion O
of O
the O
creek O
around O
the O
work O
site. O
To O
everyone\u2019s O
great O
surprise O
, O
however O
, O
the O
creek O
diversion O
caused O
water O
to O
back O
up O
underground O
into O
the O
surrounding O
farm O
fields O
through O
drainage O
tiles O
located O
under O
those O
fields. O
Both O
IDOT O
and O
the O
contractor O
were O
blissfully O
unaware O
of O
the O
tiles O
until O
angry O
farmers O
complained O
that O
they O
could O
not O
plant O
their O
mysteriously O
wet O
fields. O
In O
response O
to O
the O
angry O
neighboring O
farmers\u2019 O
complaints O
, O
IDOT O
ordered O
additional O
\u201cdewatering\u201d O
or O
diversion O
of O
the O
creek O
flow O
to O
reduce O
the O
water O
level O

that O
of O
the O
farmers\u2019 O
fields O
(specifically O
, O

Claim O
Thos. O
M. O
Madden O

(\u201cClaimant\u201d O
or O
\u201cMadden\u201d) O
filed O
a O
one O
count O

and O
miscellaneous O
costs O
of O
the O
\u201cadditional\u201d O

ordered O

IDOT. O
The O
Respondent O
did O
not O
answer O
, O
which O
our O
rules O
permit O
, O
but O
filed O
its O
Departmental O
Report O
as O
allowed O
under O
our O
rules O
and O
later O
amended O
that O
report. O
The O
Claimant O
moved O
for O
summary O
judgment O
and O
the O
Respondent O
tardily O
moved O
to O
dismiss O
the O
claim O
for O
failure O
to O
state O
a O
cause O
of O
action O
, O
asserting O
that O
the O
contract O
failed O
to O
provide O
a O
basis O
for O
Claimant O
to O
recover O
. O
Because O
both O
parties\u2019 O
motions O
squarely O
contend O
that O
this O
claim O
is O
determinable O
on O
the O
face O
of O
the O
contract O
and O
the O
pleaded O
facts O
, O
and O
because O
both O
parties O
maintain O
that O
the O
relevant O
contract O
provisions O
are O
unambiguous O
and O
*321only O
require O
interpretation O
and O
application O
to O
the O
undisputed O
facts O
, O
we O
directed O
, O
without O
objection O
, O
that O
the O
motions O
would O
be O
treated O
as O
cross-motions O
for O
summary O
judgment O
, O
(order O

Contentions O
of O
the O
Parties O
The O
Claimant O
, O
Madden O
, O
contends O
in O
essence O
that O
it O
had O
already O
met O
its O
dewatering O
and O
creek O
diversion O
duties O
under O
the O
contract O
terms O
when O
IDOT O
ordered O
the O
additional O
dewatering O
and O
that O
the O
added O
work O
was O
not O
required O
by O
any O
provision O
of O
the O
contract O
and O
is O
an O
\u201cextra\u201d O
that O
is O
separately O
compensable O
under O
the O
additional O
work O
provisions. O
Alternatively O
, O
Madden O
contends O
the O
unknown O
subsurface O
drainage O
problem O
was O
a O
changed O
condition O
that O
warrants O
additional O
compensation. O
Madden O
maintains O
that O
neither O
party O
in O
fact O
knew O
about O
the O
underground O
tiles O
in O
the O
area O
, O
that O
in O
any O
case O
it O
was O
IDOT\u2019s O
responsibility O
to O
inform O
the O
contract O
bidders O
of O
any O
such O
condition O
, O
and O
that O
as O
a O
bidder O
and O
contractor O
it O
was O
unable O
to O
determine O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
tiles O
in O
off-site O
areas O
beforehand O
because O
drainage O
tiles O
are O
not O
of O
record O
and O
because O
contractors O
lack O
access O
to O
private O
offsite O
properties O
and O
therefore O
cannot O
malee O
inspections O
or O
subsurface O
tests O
. O
The O
Respondent O
disputes O
Maddens O
claim O
in O
its O
entirety O
, O
contending O
that O
the O
additional O
dewatering O
was O
the O
contractor\u2019s O
responsibility O
under O
the O
original O
contract O
terms O
and O
was O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
contracted O
work. O
Respondent O
urges O
that O
the O
contractor O
is O
responsible O
for O
hidden O
underground O
conditions O
as O
well O
as O
avoidance O
of O
damage O
to O
private O
property O
under O
express O
contract O
terms O
, O
and O
was O
obliged O
by O
the O
contract O
to O
inspect O
the O
adjacent O
areas O
as O
well O
as O
the O
contract O
site. O
IDOT O
disputes O
the O
applicability O
of O
the O
\u201cchanged O
condition\u201d O
clause. O
IDOT O
concedes O
that O
both O
parties O
were O
in O
fact O
unaware O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
underground O
drain O
tiles O
, O
but O
claims O
that O
such O
tiles O
are O
*322commonplace O
in O
certain O
areas O
of O
Illinois O
and O
contends O
that O
this O
is O
sufficient O
to O
put O
the O
contractor O
on O
notice O
. O
The O
Contract O
Issues O
The O
interpretation O
issues O
presented O
concern O
the O
application O
of O
contract O
language O
to O
an O
unexpected O
circumstance O
\u2014 O
the O
presence O
of O
underground O
drainage O
tiles O
in O
areas O
adjacent O
to O
the O
construction O
site O
\u2014 O
in O
this O
construction O
job. O
It O
is O
undisputed O
that O
neither O
IDOT O
nor O
Madden O
actually O
knew O
beforehand O
that O
the O
subsurface O
drain O
tiles O
were O
there. O
Neither O
side O
contends O
that O
the O
off-site O
water O
backup O
was O
caused O
by O
subsurface O
conditions O
on O
the O
site O
itself. O
Both O
parties O
concede O
that O
underground O
drain O
tiles O
are O
commonplace O
in O
some O
areas O
of O
the O
State O
, O
at O
least O
in O
farm O
areas O
with O
certain O
soil O
conditions. O
A O
question O
of O
some O
precedential O
significance O
, O
therefore O
, O
is O
presented O
by O
this O
issue O
of O
who O
bears O
the O
responsibility O
for O
unknown O
underground O
tiles O
in O
IDOT O
construction O
projects O
under O
IDOTs O
standard O
specifications O
for O
road O
and O
bridge O
construction O
(\u201cStandard O

which O
are O

. O
Of O
course O
, O
in O
construing O
this O

, O
it O
is O
axiomatic O
that O
the O
specific O
contract O
provisions O
directed O
at O
the O

project O
ordinarily O
take O
precedence O
, O
as O
a O

Discussion O
This O
contract O
dispute O
presents O
two O
predicates O
of O
liability O
for O
our O
consideration. O
First O
is O
the O
Claimants O
argument O
that O
the O
additional O
dewatering O
work O
is O
a O
simple O
extra O
outside O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
original O
contract O
work O
(i.e. O
, O
the O
dewatering O
specified O
in O
the O
contract) O
, O
but O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
\u201cadditional O
payment\u201d O
provision O
of O
the O
contract O
(section O
9 O
of O
the O
bid). O
Second O
is O
the O
contractors O
alternative O
theory O
that O
the O
unknown O
underground O
drain O
tiles O
constituted O
a O
changed O
condition O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
*325article O
104.04 O
of O
the O
standard O
provision. O
The O
parties\u2019 O
arguments O
all O
fall O
within O
these O
two O
theories O
. O
The O
contractor\u2019s O
argument O
about O
its O
inability O
to O
ascertain O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
subsurface O
tiles O
\u2014 O
because O
they O
are O
not O
of O
record O
and O
are O
located O
on O
private O
property O
to O
which O
bidders O
and O
IDOT O
itself O
normally O
lack O
access O
for O
onsite O
inspection O
\u2014 O
relates O
to O
the O
changed O
condition O
theory O
of O
the O
case. O
Similarly O
, O
two O
of O
IDOT\u2019s O
contentions O
similarly O
relate O
to O
the O
changed O
condition O
analysis O
and O
its O
allocation O
of O
responsibility O
for O
undisclosed O
or O
unknown O
conditions O
affecting O
performance O
of O
the O
contract: O
the O
article O
102.05 O
duty O
of O
the O
contractor O
to O
inspect O
the O
site O
and O
be O
informed O
about O
the O
local O
conditions; O
and O
the O
article O
102.05 O
provision O
making O
the O
bidder O
responsible O
for O
errors O
in O
his O
bid O
. O
Similarly O
, O
IDOT\u2019s O
arguments O
about O
the O
contractor\u2019s O
article O
107.19 O
contract O
duty O
to O
avoid O
damage O
to O
property O
and O
its O
article O
502.01 O
contract O
duty O
to O
drain O
and O
pump O
excavation O
sites O
both O
relate O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
the O
\u201cadditional\u201d O
pumping O
ordered O
by O
IDOT O
was O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
contracted O
work O
. O
Having O
sorted O
out O
the O
issues O
, O
it O
becomes O
clear O
that O
the O
two O
issues O
presented O
are O
alternative O
theories O
factually O
as O
well O
as O
legally O
, O
and O
that O
the O
threshold O
question O
for O
our O
determination O
is O
the O
scope O
of O
work O
dispute. O
This O
is O
because O
the O
two O
legal O
theories O
have O
fundamentally O
different O
and O
inconsistent O
factual O
predicates O
. O
The O
\u201cextra\u201d O
work O
theory O
is O
based O
on O
the O
factual/contractual O
premise O
that O
the O
additional O
disputed O
work O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
additional O
disputed O
compensation O
, O
was O
not O
the O
responsibility O
of O
the O
contractor O
under O
the O
original O
contract. O
In O
such O
event O
, O
the O
disputed O
work O
became O
a O
duty O
only O
because O
of O
a O
supplemental O
work O
order O
which O
in O
effect O
became O
an O
amendment O
to O
the O
contract O
that O
was O
previously O
*326contemplated O
and O
authorized O
by O
the O
parties O
in O
their O
original O
contract. O
Where O
that O
is O
the O
case O
(i.e. O
, O
if O
the O
additional O
work O
is O
found O
to O
be O
supplemental O
to O
the O
contract-specified O
work) O
then O
the O
dispute O
is O
resolved O
by O
straightforward O
application O
of O
the O
payment O
provisions O
to O
the O
additional O
work. O
In O
that O
circumstance O
, O
the O
\u201cchanged O
condition\u201d O
analysis O
does O
not O
apply O
, O
because O
the O
\u201cadditional\u201d O
work O
is O
an O
add-on O
that O
was O
not O
covered O
by O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
original O
contract O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
bid O
or O
let O
. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
where O
the O
disputed O
work O
is O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
the O
original O
contract O
, O
the O
\u201cchanged O
condition\u201d O
analysis O
is O
applicable O
\u2014 O
under O
the O
contractual O
changed O
conditions O
clause O
\u2014 O
as O
the O
primary O
contract O
term O
that O
governs O
unknown O
conditions O
and O
similar O
surprises. O
The O
changed O
condition O
analysis O
pertains O
to O
the O
conditions O
and O
circumstances O
that O
affect O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
contracted O
work. O
The O
court O
must O
emphasize O
, O
however O
, O
that O
contrary O
to O
the O
Respondents O
arguments O
in O
this O
case O
, O
it O
is O
well O

that O

articles O

conditions O

Article O
104.04 O
recognizes O
two O
classes O
of O
changed O
conditions. O
The O
first O
type O
of O
changed O
condition O
is O
a O
subsurface O
or O
latent O
physical O
condition O
which O
differs O
materially O
from O
that O
which O
is O
indicated O
by O
the O
contract O
documents. O
The O
second O
type O
of O
changed O
condition O
occurs O
where O
the O
contractor O
encounters O
a O
subsurface O
or O
latent O
physical O
condition O
which O
differs O
materially O
from O
that O
which O
is O
ordinarily O
encountered O
and O
generally O
recognized O
as O
inherent O
in O
the O
work O
of O
the O
character O
provided O
for O
in O
the O
contract O
documents.\u201d O
Changed O
conditions O
provisions O
typically O
allocate O
the O
risks O
of O
unknown O
conditions O
and O
are O
especially O
important O
when O
encountering O
, O
as O
here O
, O
unknown O
and O
possibly O
unknowable O
subsurface O
conditions O
and O
structures. O
The O
competing O
considerations O
are O
important O
both O
in O
individual O
cases O
, O
and O
in O
the O
general O
case O
, O
because O
the O
allocation O
of O
*327risk O
for O
unknowns O
as O
between O
the O
contractor O
and O
the O
State O
affects O
the O

the O
State: O
\u201cThe O
starting O
point O
of O
the O
policy O

clause O
is O
the O
great O
risk O
, O
for O

on O
construction O

adverse O
subsurface O
conditions: O

Whenever O
dependable O
information O
on O
the O
subsurface O
is O
unavailable O
, O
bidders O
will O
make O
their O
own O
borings O
or O
, O
more O
likely O
, O
include O
in O
their O
bids O
a O
contingency O
element O
to O
cover O
the O
risk. O
Either O
alternative O
inflates O
the O
costs O
to O
the O
Government. O
The O
Government O
therefore O
often O
makes O
such O
borings O
and O
provides O
them O
for O
the O
use O
of O
the O
bidders O
, O
as O
part O
of O
a O
contract O
containing O
the O
standard O

clause O
. O
Bidders O
are O
thereby O
given O
information O
on O
which O
they O
may O
rely O
in O
making O
their O

, O
and O
are O
at O
the O

time O

an O
equitable O
adjustment O
under O
the O

, O
if O
subsurface O
conditions O
turn O
out O
to O
be O
materially O
different O
than O
those O
indicated O
* O
s O
*. O
The O
two O
elements O
work O
together; O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
changed O
conditions O
clause O
works O
to O
reassure O
bidders O
that O
they O
may O
confidently O
rely O
on O
the O
logs O
and O
need O
not O
include O
a O
contingency O
element O
in O
their O
bids. O
Reliance O
is O
affirmatively O
desired O
by O
the O
Government O
, O
for O
if O
bidders O
feel O
they O
cannot O
rely O
, O
they O
will O
revert O
to O
the O
practice O
of O
increasing O
their O
bids O
. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O

conditions O
clause O
is O
thus O
to O
take O
at O

some O
of O
the O

We O
thus O
turn O
to O
the O
analysis O
of O
whether O
the O

work O
was O
, O
or O
was O
not O
, O
within O
the O
scope O

Madden O
cites O
the O
dewatering O
language O
of O
the O
contract O
(quoted O
in O
full O
above) O
, O
and O
emphasizes O
that O
it O
was O
required O
to O
, O
and O
did O
, O
submit O
a O
specific O
dewatering O
plan O
that O
the O
IDOT O

approved O
, O
and O
claims O
that O
this O
satisfied O
its O
dewatering O
and O
creek O
diversion O
obligations O
under O
the O
original O
contract O
. O
The O
Respondent O
contends O
, O
initially O
, O
that O
Madden O
was O
required O
\u201cto O
divert O
the O
flow O
of O
the O
creek O
during O
construction O
to O
prevent O
water O
from O
invading O
the O
construction O
*328area\u201d O
and O
that O
this O
diversion O
was O
\u201cintended O
* O
* O
* O
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
contractors O
price.\u201d O
Respondent O
emphasizes O
that O
the O
standard O
specification O
for O
excavation O
, O
article O
502.01 O
, O
makes O
it O
clear O
that O
Madden O
had O
the O
duty O
to O
perform O
all O
pumping O
and O
draining O
\u201cnecessary O
for O
the O
satisfactory O
completion O
of O
the O
project.\u201d O
Secondarily O
, O
the O
Respondent O
contends O
that O
the O
contractors O
duty O
to O
avoid O
damage O
to O
private O
property O
under O
article O
107.19 O
, O
which O
specifically O
includes O
\u201ccrops O
, O
\u201d O
imposed O
a O
duty O
on O
Madden O
to O
effect O
sufficient O
diversion O
of O
the O
creek O
to O
avoid O
the O
situation O
that O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
occurred O
. O
On O
the O
first O
component O
of O
the O
analysis O
, O
which O
turns O
on O
the O
contract O
specifications O
of O
the O
dewatering/diversion O
work O
, O
we O
find O
that O
Madden O
clearly O
had O
the O
duty O
to O
perform O
such O
dewatering O
of O
the O
site O
as O
was O
necessary O
\u201cin O
order O
to O
keep O
the O
construction O
areas O
free O
of O
water\u201d O
(emphasis O
added) O
and O
nothing O
more. O
Madden O
was O
not O
contractually O
bound O
to O
meet O
any O
other O
standard O
of O
performance O
and O
its O
contract O
obligation O
was O
not O
with O
reference O
to O
any O
area O
beyond O
the O
construction O
site O
itself O
. O
Article O
502.01 O
, O
cited O
by O
the O
Respondent O
, O
is O
immaterial: O
it O
adds O
nothing O
to O
the O
analysis O
, O
as O
it O
is O
purely O
descriptive O
and O
sets O
forth O
no O
performance O
standards O
whatsoever. O
The O
fact O
that O
IDOT O
approved O
a O
specific O
dewatering O
plan O
that O
contemplated O
a O
particular O
flow O
diversion O
that O
was O
less O
than O
a O
100% O
diversion O
of O
the O
creek O
is O
just O
icing O
on O
this O
particular O
cake. O
IDOT O
could O
have O
, O
but O
did O
not O
, O
specify O
a O
dewatering O
standard O
in O
its O
contract O
specifications O
\u2014 O
which O
could O
have O
been O
a O
water-flow O
standard O
or O
a O
percentage O
of O
the O
creek O
flow O
standard O
or O
, O
as O
IDOT O
finally O
chose O
in O
its O
supplemental O
work O
order O
, O
an O
elevation O
standard. O
But O
having O
elected O
not O
to O
impose O
a O
specific O
standard O
on O
this O
dewatering O
work O
, O
and O
having O
failed O
to O
show O
or O
even O
to O
contend O
that O
the O
contractor O
failed O
to O
meet O
the O
only O

IDOT O
cannot O
now O
claim O
that O
the O

required O
more O
work O
than O
Madden O
performed O
with O
its O
own O
approval O
. O
The O
second O
component O
of O
the O
scope O
of O
work O
analysis O
is O
a O
closer O
question. O
Article O
107.19 O
of O
the O
standard O
specifications O
, O
imposing O
a O
duty O
to O
protect O
private O
property O
, O
including O
crops O
, O
that O
are O
\u201ccontiguous O
to O
the O
work O
, O
\u201d O
which O
the O
Respondent O
cites O
to O
us O
, O
is O
plainly O
an O
imposition O
of O
an O
important O
duty O
on O
IDOT O
construction O
contractors O
and O
is O
clearly O
germane O
here. O
However O
, O
we O
are O
not O
persuaded O
that O
this O
provision O
is O
broad O
enough O
or O
strong O
enough O
to O
reach O
the O
facts O
presented O
in O
this O
case O
, O
for O
several O
reasons O
. O
First O
, O
the O
private O
property O
that O
was O
here O
affected O
by O
the O
contractors O
performance O
was O
not O
merely O
contiguous O
to O
the O
work O
site O
, O
but O
extended O
considerable O
distances O
from O
the O
creek O
and O
bridge; O
this O
\u201ccontiguous\u201d O
property O
language O
is O
simply O
not O
aimed O
at O
, O
and O
does O
not O
encompass O
, O
non-adjacent O
drainage O
problems O
as O
are O
involved O
in O
this O
case. O
Second O
, O
a O
reading O
of O
the O
entire O
article O
107.09 O
indicates O
that O
its O
focus O
is O
on O
physical O
damage O
due O
to O
movement O
or O
alteration O
of O
structures O
and O
ground. O
Although O
the O
language O
is O
broad O
enough O
to O
encompass O
water O
damage O
caused O
by O
construction O
activities O
, O
the O
language O
is O
just O
not O
broad O
enough O
or O
specific O
enough O
to O
reach O
the O
kind O
of O
underground O
drainage O
problems O
that O
are O
not O
specific O
to O
the O
construction O
site. O
Indeed O
, O
if O
this O
language O
were O
construed O
to O
reach O
drainage O
problems O
on O
non-adjacent O
properties O
, O
it O
would O
impose O
a O
substantial O
and O
unpredictable O
risk O
on O
every O
contractor O
in O
every O
urbanized O
or O
suburbanized O
area O
of O
the O
State O
\u2014 O
where O
water O
deliveiy O
and O
drainage O
systems O
are O
always O
present O
\u2014 O
and O
in O
every O
rural O
project O
where O
a O
local O
water O
source O
is O
present. O
Imposition O
of O
such O
far-reaching O
risks O
without O
specific O
language O
mandating O
them O
is O
not O
*330our O
province. O
We O
find O
no O
such O
language O
in O
any O
of O
IDOTs O
standard O
specifications O
to O
which O
we O
have O
been O
directed O
. O
IDOT O
is O
free O
to O
alter O
its O
standard O
specifications O
to O
impose O
such O
extensive O
drainage O
responsibilities O
on O
its O
contractors O
, O
if O
it O
chooses O
, O
notwithstanding O
Maddens O
protest O
that O
it O
\u2014 O
like O
all O
bidders O
and O
contractors O
\u2014 O
lacks O
the O
knowledge O
and O
the O
access O
to O
obtain O
the O
knowledge O
of O
underground O
conditions O
on O
off-site O
properties O
from O
which O
it O
could O
calculate O
a O
reasonable O
risk-cost O
to O
include O
in O
its O
bid. O
That O
is O
a O
policy O
decision O
for O
IDOT O
to O
make. O
We O
find O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
current O
provision O
at O
issue O
here O
just O
does O
not O
reach O
or O
encompass O
the O
kind O
of O
drainage O
backup O
problem O
on O
adjacent O
and O
non-adjacent O
farmlands O
as O
occurred O
in O
this O
case. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
again O
find O
that O
the O
\u201cadditional\u201d O
dewatering O
work O
directed O
by O
IDOT O
was O
not O
work O
that O
was O
required O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
original O
contract O
. O
Conclusion O
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
we O
find O
that O
the O
additional O
dewatering O
work O
directed O
by O
IDOT O
was O
a O
contract O
addition O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
original O
contract O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Claimant O
is O
entitled O
to O
additional O
compensation O
for O
its O
additional O
performance O
. O
Given O
this O
finding O
, O
and O
in O
accordance O
with O
our O
analysis O
above O
, O
there O
is O
no O
need O
to O
decide O
the O
alternative O
\u201cchanged O
condition\u201d O
theory O
of O
liability. O
We O
observe O
, O
in O
passing O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
applicability O
of O
the O
changed O
condition O
doctrine O
is O
at O
least O
seemingly O
inapplicable O
to O
this O
claim O
, O
as O
neither O
party O
has O
even O
alleged O
that O
the O
subsurface O
drainage O
\u201ccondition\u201d O
had O
any O
impact O
on O
the O
performance O
of O
the O
construction O
work O
, O
and O
in O
light O
of O
our O
rejection O
of O
the O
contention O
that O
the O
contractor O
was O
contractually O
responsible O
for O
these O
off-site O
property O
damages O
. O
*331Although O
the O
Respondent O

not O
disputed O
the O
damages O
claimed O

in O
its O

the O

to O

a O

criminal O
record. O
Further O
investigation O
by O
the O
police O
confirmed O
that O
the O
victim O
was O
at O
the O
scene O
of O
the O
shooting O
because O
of O
a O
prior O
incident. O
The O
man O
eventually O
arrested O
for O
shooting O
Mr. O
Thomas O
admitted O
that O
the O
motive O
for O
the O
shooting O
was O
a O
previous O
gang O
altercation O
. O
It O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
victim O
and O
the O
alleged O
offender O
in O
this O
case O
were O
from O
opposing O
street O
gangs. O
This O
incident O
occurred O
because O
of O
their O
gang O
affiliation O
, O
gang O
rivalry O
and O
previous O
gang O
incidents. O
The O
victims O
conduct O
and O
his O
membership O
in O
a O
gang O
provoked O
and O
contributed O
to O
his O
own O
death O
and O
, O
therefore O
, O
the O
claim O
will O
be O
denied O
under O
740 O
ILCS O
45/10.1(d) O
, O
which O
states O
that O
an O

where O
the O
decedent O
provoked O
and O
contributed O
to O

. O
Claimant O
appeared O
pro O

and O
presented O
evidence O
to O
the O
Court. O
The O
facts O
as O
presented O
in O
the O
hearing O
transcript O
are O
as O
follows: O
Claimant O
and O
her O
husband O
, O
John O
Doe O
, O
were O
divorced O
on O
April O
19 O
, O
1989. O
Mrs. O
Doe O
was O
given O
custody O
of O
Joan O
and O
her O
two O
minor O
brothers. O
The O
children O
are O
triplets O
bom O
on O
September O
23 O
, O
1984. O
The O
divorce O
settlement O
provided O
that O
Mr. O
Doe O
was O
to O
have O
visitation O
with O
the O
children O
so O
long O
as O
visitation O
was O
supervised O
by O
Mrs. O
Doe O
or O
another O
adult O
approved O
by O
Mrs. O
Doe O
. O
In O
the O
early O
months O
of O
1992 O
, O
Joan O
and O
her O
brothers O
were O
enrolled O
in O
the O
Life O
Span O
Program. O
Life O
Span O
is O
a O
domestic O
violence O
agency O
which O
provides O
counseling O
for O
young O
children. O
The O
children O
were O
enrolled O
in O
the O
program O
by O
their O
mother O
to O
help O
them O
deal O
with O
their O
fathers O
alcoholism O
and O
erratic O
behavior. O
Lynn O
James O
, O
a O
childrens O
counselor O
with O
Life O
Span O
testified O
as O
to O
the O
events O
she O
observed O
at O
Life O
Span. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
every O
Life O
Span O
meeting O
the O
participants O
were O
required O
to O
sign O
their O
names O
on O
an O
attendance O
sheet. O
Ms. O
James O
and O
the O
other O
counselors O
notice O
that O
, O
although O
there O
was O
no O
child O
named O
Susan O
registered O
for O
the O
program O
, O
the O
name O
Susan O
continued O
to O
appear O
on O
the O
sign-in O
sheet O
over O
a O
period O
of O
several O
weeks. O
On O
February O
4 O
, O
1992 O
, O
the O
counselors O
figured O
out O
that O
"Susan\u201d O
was O
Joan O
Doe. O
Ms. O
James O
asked O
Joan O
who O
Susan O
was. O
Joan O
told O
Ms. O
James O
that O
Susan O
was O
her O
friend. O
Joan O
was O
asked O
if O
Susan O
had O
family O
problems. O
*624Joan O
told O
Ms. O
James O
that O
\u201cher O
father O
does O
things O
to O
her O
that O
scare O
her.\u201d O
Ms. O
James O
advised O
Mrs. O
Doe O
of O
this O
conversation. O
Mrs. O
Doe O
assured O
Ms. O
James O
that O
Joan O
had O
no O
friends O
or O
neighbors O
named O
Susan O
. O
Two O
days O
later O
, O
Ms. O
James O
again O
spoke O
to O
Joan O
about O
\u201cSusan.\u201d O
Joan O
said O
Susan O
was O
very O
scared O
because O
Susans O
father O
touched O
her. O
Joan O
proceeded O
to O
relate O
incidents O
of O
Susans O
father O
touching O
her O
\u201cprivate O
parts\u201d O
when O
she O
was O
in O
the O
shower O
and O
in O
her O
fathers O
bedroom. O
The O
child O
reverted O
to O
present O
tense O
in O
describing O
several O
of O
these O
incidents. O
Joan O
drew O
a O
picture O
of O
Susan O
for O
Ms. O
James O
which O
physically O
matched O
Joan\u2019s O
appearance. O
Joan O
asked O
her O
mother O
to O
call O
Ms. O
James O
after O
her O
next O
visitation O
with O
her O
father. O
She O
told O
Ms. O
James O
\u201cI O
saw O
Susan O
today O
and O
Susan\u2019s O
father O
hurt O
her O
today.\u201d O
Ms. O
James O
believed O
that O
Susan O
was O
really O
Joan O
and O
that O
the O
seven-year-old O
had O
been O
molested O
by O
her O
father. O
Susan/Joan O
had O
also O
shown O
where O
she O
had O
been O
touched O
via O
drawings O
. O
Ms. O
James O
contacted O
DCFS O
which O
sent O
a O
caseworker O
to O
Mrs. O
Doe\u2019s O
home O
on O
February O
9 O
, O
1992. O
Joan O
refused O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
she O
had O
been O
molested O
by O
her O
father O
during O
this O
interview. O
A O
medical O
exam O
later O
that O
evening O
proved O
inconclusive O
as O
to O
signs O
of O
penetration. O
Ms. O
James O
stated O
that O
Joan O
had O
never O
discussed O
an O
incident O
of O
full O
penetration O
which O
would O
be O
consistent O
with O
the O
physical O
examination O
findings. O
Additionally O
, O
Joan O
told O
Ms. O
James O
she O
thought O
going O
to O
the O
hospital O
was O
a O
good O
idea O
as O
she O
might O
be O
\u201ccontagious.\u201d O
Joan O
subsequently O
told O
Ms. O
James O
that O
she O
had O
told O
her O
father O
about O
her O
conversation O
with O
Ms. O
James O
and O
that O
he O
had O
stopped O
hurting O
her O
and O
she O
(Joan) O
didn\u2019t O
want O
to O
talk O
about O
it O
anymore O
. O
Joan O
was O
given O
another O
physical O
examination O
on O
February O
27 O
, O
1992 O
, O
and O
another O
interview O
at O
Columbus O
Hospital. O
Again O
, O
the O
results O
were O
inconclusive O
and O
Claimant O
*625was O
advised O
that O
her O
former O
husband O
could O
not O
be O
prosecuted O
if O
Joan O
refused O
to O
specifically O
admit O
that O
her O
father O
had O
molested O
her. O
It O
is O
the O
opinion O
of O
Ms. O
James O
that O
Joan O
was O
molested O
. O
Ms. O
James O
suggested O
that O
Joan O
would O
benefit O
from O
additional O
therapy. O
Mrs. O
Doe O
engaged O
Dr. O
Susan O
Babb O
, O
a O
licensed O
clinical O
psychologist. O
Dr. O
Babb O
specializes O
in O
working O
with O
early O
childhood O
disorders O
and O
adolescents. O
Although O
she O
does O
not O
specialize O
in O
child O
sexual O
abuse O
, O
she O
testified O
that O
she O
has O
had O
extensive O
experience O
in O
that O
area O
of O
practice O
. O
Joan O
began O
seeing O
Dr. O
Babb O
on O
March O
9 O
, O
1992 O
, O
and O
was O
continuing O
to O
see O
her O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
hearing. O
Dr. O
Babb O
testified O
that O
Joan O
continued O
to O
deny O
that O
she O
was O
molested O
when O
asked O
directly. O
However O
, O
Joan O
has O
also O
been O
consistent O
in O
providing O
indirect O
evidence O
which O
Dr. O
Babb O
found O
\u201ccompelling\u201d O
that O
she O
was O
molested O
by O
her O
father O
, O
beginning O
at O
approximately O
age O
three. O
Joan O
was O
also O
consistent O
in O
her O
therapy O
with O
Dr. O
Babb O
in O
lapsing O
into O
the O
first O
person O
when O
relating O
\u201cSusans\u201d O
history O
of O
molestation. O
However O
, O
she O
was O
fiercely O
protective O
of O
her O
family O
as O
a O
cohesive O
unit O
and O
unable O
to O
directly O
accuse O
her O
father O
of O
molestation. O
Dr. O
Babb O
also O
felt O
that O
Joan O
was O
seeking O
approval O
from O
her O
father O
and O
felt O
she O
had O
failed O
him O
in O
some O
way O
due O
to O
his O
lack O
of O
attentiveness. O
Joan O
had O
continued O
to O
be O
an O
excellent O
student O
but O
had O
what O
Dr. O
Babb O
described O
as O
anxiety-related O
problems O
at O
home. O
Joan O
also O
made O
drawings O
which O
identified O
the O
areas O
which O
were O
touched O
by O
\u201cSusans\u201d O
father. O
These O
drawings O
were O
consistent O
with O
those O
Joan O
made O
for O
Ms. O
James O
and O
indicated O
the O
child O
had O
been O
touched O
in O
a O
sexually O
explicit O
manner O
with O
her O
fathers O
penis O
on O
her O
mouth O
, O
anus O
and O
vagina O
. O
On O
cross-examination O
, O
Dr. O
Babb O
stated O
that O
in O
her O
professional O
opinion O
, O
Joan O
had O
been O
molested O
but O
was O
unable O
*626to O
verbalize O
the O
incidents O
directiy O
due O
to O
her O
age O
and O
the O
trauma O
these O
events O
had O
wrought O
. O
Dr. O
Babb O
also O
reviewed O
a O
psychological O
evaluation O
by O
Dr. O
Lynne O
H. O
Shebon O
, O
Ph.D. O
Dr. O
Shebon O
tested O
Joan O
on O
Dr. O
Babb\u2019s O
recommendation. O
Dr. O
Shebons O
report O
was O
made O
part O
of O
the O
record. O
Dr. O
Shebons O
report O
did O
not O
indicate O
a O
finding O
of O
sexual O
abuse. O
However O
, O
she O
made O
findings O
similar O
to O
those O
of O
Dr. O
Babb O
with O
regard O
to O
Joan\u2019s O
anxiety O
over O
the O
divorce O
and O
her O
father\u2019s O
unavailability. O
It O
was O
also O
noted O
that O
Joan O
felt O
she O
was O
in O
some O
way O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
break-up O
of O
her O
family. O
Dr. O
Shebon O
recommends O
that O
\u201ccontinued O
inquiry O
into O
the O
nature O
of O
possible O
threats O
to O
Joan\u2019s O
sense O
of O
safety O
is O
urged.\u201d O
The O
State O
presented O
no O
testimony O
at O
hearing O
. O
Claimant O
has O
provided O
no O
direct O
evidence O
of O
physical O
sexual O
abuse O
which O
would O
constitute O
a O
crime O
under O
the O
Act. O
The O
young O
victim O
has O
never O
directly O
accused O
her O
father O
of O
the O
alleged O
acts. O
We O
cannot O
assume O
the O
alleged O
crime O
occurred O
based O
upon O
the O
evidence O
available O
herein O
. O
We O
note O
that O
the O
allegations O
herein O
are O
of O
a O
most O
serious O
and O
heinous O
nature. O
If O
the O
young O
victim O
is O
able O
to O
provide O
more O
information O
as O
to O
tire O
alleged O
assaults O
resulting O
in O
charges O
against O
the O
perpetrator O
at O
some O
later O
date O
, O
she O
may O
refile O
this O
action O
any O
time O
before O
she O
reaches O
the O
age O
of O
majority O
. O
Claimant O
has O
failed O
to O
prove O
that O
a O
violent O
crime O
as O
defined O
by O
the O
Act O
has O
occurred. O
This O
claim O
does O
not O
meet O

at O
which O
time O
Willie O

appeared O
and O

Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
presented O
a O
photocopy O
of O

of O
a O

The O

drawn O
on O
an O
account O
in O
the O
name O
of O

Laborers\u2019 O
Annuity O
and O
Benefit O
Fund. O
The O
copy O
of O
the O
reverse O
of O
the O
check O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
endorsed O
by O
the O
funeral O
home O
and O
deposited O
in O
its O
own O
account. O
The O
second O
page O
of O
Claimant\u2019s O
exhibit O

was O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
form O
entitled O
, O
\u201cRefund O
to O

, O
\u201d O
which O
was O
signed O
by O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
on O
November O
13 O
, O
1992. O
The O
form O
specified O
that O
*629the O
Laborers\u2019 O
and O
Retirement O
Board O
Employees\u2019 O
Annuity O
and O
Benefit O
Fund O
of O
Chicago O
(hereinafter O
the O
\u201cFund\u201d) O
was O
requested O
and O
authorized O
to O
make O
payment O
to O
Wallace O
Westend O
Funeral O
Home O
and O
the O
balance O
of O
any O
sums O
remaining O
were O
to O
be O
paid O
to O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
. O
At O
the O
April O
hearing O
, O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
was O
not O
sure O
whether O
the O
funds O
were O
death O
benefits O
, O
retirement O
benefits O
or O
deferred O
compensation. O
He O
presented O
a O
letter O
addressed O
to O
him O
from O
the O
Fund O
indicating O
that O
the O
Fund O
granted O
a O
refund O
to O
the O
account O
of O
the O
deceased O
victim O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$40 O
, O
224.22. O
The O
letter O
also O
indicated O
that O
the O
sum O
of O
$3 O
, O
839 O
was O
going O
to O
be O
deducted O
and O
paid O
to O
the O
funeral O
home. O
It O
appears O
that O
this O
payment O
is O
not O
a O
death O
benefit O
but O
part O
of O
the O
retirement O
refund O
. O
The O
Respondent O
indicated O
that O
the O
funeral O
home O
may O
have O
been O
paid O
twice O
, O
once O
by O
the O
Fund O
and O
also O
by O
the O
State. O
The O
funeral O
home O
signed O
an O
affidavit O
indicating O
payment O
from O
James O
Patterson. O
According O
to O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
, O
James O
Patterson O
was O
with O
him O
on O
November O
13 O
, O
1992 O
, O
when O
he O
signed O
the O
\u201cRefund O
to O
Heirs\u201d O
form O
and O
was O
aware O
that O
the O
sum O
stated O
would O
be O
paid O
to O
the O
funeral O
home O
. O
A O
second O
continued O
hearing O
was O
held O
on O
July O
30 O
, O
1995. O
The O
order O
setting O
the O
hearing O
was O
mailed O
to O
both O
Claimants. O
At O
the O
July O
hearing O
, O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
appeared. O
James O
Patterson O
did O
not O
appear. O
Mr. O
Vernon O
Wallace O
, O
the O
owner O
of O
Wallace O
Westend O
Funeral O
Home O
, O
appeared O
pursuant O
to O
subpoena O
by O
the O
Attorney O
General\u2019s O
office. O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
testified O
that O
James O
Patterson O
was O
not O
a O
beneficiary O
of O
the O
Fund. O
James O
Patterson O
filed O
the O
crime O
victims O
compensation O
application O
before O
he O
knew O
anything O
about O
it. O
He O
received O
a O
bill O
from O
Wallace O
Funeral O
Home O
for O
$3 O
, O
839 O
. O
Mr. O
Wallace O
testified O
that O
he O
received O
the O
$3 O
, O
839 O
from O
the O
Fund O
and O
received O
the O
$2 O
, O
500 O
from O
the O
State. O
*630He O
agreed O
that O
the O
funeral O
home O
was O
paid O
twice. O
He O
stated O
that O
his O
records O
indicated O
that O
he O
refunded O
the O
$2 O
, O
500 O
paid O
by O
the O
State O
to O
James O
Patterson. O
He O
also O
beheves O
he O
saw O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
in O
his O
office. O
He O
believes O
James O
Patterson O
indicated O
that O
the O
money O
should O
be O
reimbursed O
to O
him O
because O
he O
, O
James O
Patterson O
, O
forwarded O
the O
Funds O
payment O
to O
the O
funeral O
home. O
Mr. O
Wallace O
did O
not O
recall O
whether O
the O
$2 O
, O
500 O
check O
from O
the O
State O
was O
co-payable O
to O
James O
Patterson O
and O
the O
funeral O
home. O
He O
did O
not O
recall O
whether O
James O
Patterson O
specifically O
requested O
a O
refund. O
It O
is O
his O
normal O
procedure O
to O
refund O
automatically O
when O
he O
receives O
an O
overpayment. O
Mr. O
Wallace O
indicated O
that O
he O
would O
provide O
copies O
of O
his O
records O
within O
one O
day O
of O
the O
hearing. O
However O
, O
no O
records O
have O
been O
received O
from O
Mr. O
Wallace O
. O
On O
July O
20 O
, O
1995 O
, O
Respondent O
sent O
a O
letter O
to O
James O
Patterson O
asking O
him O
to O
contact O
the O
Attorney O
General O
s O
office. O
On O
August O
24 O
, O
1995 O
, O
the O
Respondent O
sent O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
Commissioner O
which O
indicated O
that O
Todd O
Magee O
, O
nephew O
of O
James O
Patterson O
, O
requested O
, O
via O
a O
telephone O
conversation O
, O
another O
date O
so O
that O
testimony O
could O
be O
presented O
that O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
was O
not O
telling O
the O
truth. O
On O
August O
29 O
, O
1995 O
, O
the O
Commissioner O
had O
a O
telephone O
conference O
with O
the O
Respondent O
and O
confirmed O
that O
the O
Attorney O
General O
s O
office O
had O
not O
received O
documents O
from O
Mr. O
Wallace O
. O
Subsequent O
to O
the O
July O
hearing O
, O
the O
Court O
received O
copies O
of O
the O
two O
State O
warrants O
, O
together O
with O
copies O
of O
the O
reverse O
sides O
showing O
the O
endorsements. O
Exhibit O
number O
2 O
is O
a O
copy O
of O
warrant O
number O
9614231 O
, O
dated O
May O
26 O
, O
1994 O
, O
payable O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
$2 O
, O
500 O
made O
co-payable O
to O
Patterson O
, O
James O
&amp; O
Wallace O
Broadview O
Funeral O
Home. O
The O
reverse O
side O
indicates O
that O
both O
James O
Patterson O
and O
Vernon O
Wallace O
endorsed O
the O
check O
and O
it O
was O
*631apparently O
deposited O
in O
the O
funeral O
homes O
account O
on O
approximately O
June O
14 O
, O
1994. O
The O
endorsements O
and O
deposit O
took O
place O
approximately O
18 O
months O
after O
Wallace O
Westend O
Funeral O
Home O
received O
payment O
from O
the O
Fund. O
(Emphasis O
added.) O
Exhibit O
number O
3 O
is O
a O
$500 O
warrant O
, O
dated O
May O
26 O
, O
1994 O
, O
and O
is O
payable O
to O
James O
Patterson. O
It O
was O
apparently O
endorsed O
and O
cashed O
by O
James O
Patterson O
on O
June O
1 O
, O
1994 O
. O
Based O
on O
the O
evidence O
, O
the O
Court O
finds O
that O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
directed O
the O
Laborers\u2019 O
Annuity O
and O
Benefit O
Fund O
to O
pay O
$3 O
, O
839 O
to O
Wallace O
Westend O
Funeral O
Home O
for O
the O
funeral O
and O
burial O
of O
the O
deceased O
victim. O
The O
Fund O
paid O
the O
sum O
requested O
to O
the O
funeral O
home. O
Section O
10.1(c) O
of O
the O
Act O
allows O
a O
relative O
of O
the O
deceased O
victim O
to O
seek O
compensation O
for O
funeral O
expenses O
which O
he O
has O
paid O
or O
is O
obligated O
to O
pay. O
Section O
10.1(e) O
provides O
that O
an O
award O
shall O
be O
reduced O
by O
the O
amount O
of O
benefits O
, O
payments O
or O
awards O
listed O
in O
section O
7.1(a)(7) O
of O
the O
Act. O
Clause O
(j) O
of O
subsection O
(a)(7) O
requires O
the O
listing O
of O
\u201cany O
other O
source.\u201d O
The O
payment O
from O
the O
Fund O
falls O
into O
the O
\u201cother O
source\u201d O
category O
. O
Section O
10.1(e) O
expressly O
excepts O
from O
the O
reduction O
requirement: O
\u201c* O
\u00b0 O
* O
annuities O
, O
pension O
plans O
, O
Federal O
Social O
Security O
payments O
payable O

of O
the O

and O
the O

of O
the O

$25 O

of O
life O
insurance O
that O
would O
inure O
to O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
applicant O
6 O
e O
The O
Court O
further O
finds O
that O
the O
$40 O
, O
224.22 O
, O
and O
particularly O
the O
portion O
thereof O
used O
for O
funeral O
expenses O
, O
was O
a O
benefit O
, O
award O
or O
payment O
from O
\u201cother O
sources\u201d O
and O
reduced O
the O
funeral O
expenses O
paid O
by O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
Claimant O
, O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
, O
is O
not O
entided O
to O
any O
compensation O
under O
the O
Act O
. O
The O
Act O
specifically O
provides O
that O
benefits O
, O
payments O
or O
awards O
payable O
from O
pension O
plans O
do O
not O
reduce O
an O
*632award O
pursuant O
to O
the O
Act O
except O
when O
such O
payments O
are O
payable O
to O
\u201cdependents\u201d O
of O
the O
victim. O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
has O
not O
shown O
that O
he O
was O
dependent O
on O
the O
deceased O
victim. O
The O
use O
of O
the O
words O
\u201cpension O
plans\u201d O
in O
the O
reduction O
exception O
indicates O
that O
the O
General O
Assembly O
intended O
to O
exempt O
payments O
from O
pension O
plans O
only O
when O
received O
by O
dependents. O
It O
is O
reasonable O
to O
conclude O
that O
the O
General O
Assembly O
, O
therefore O
, O
intended O
for O
payments O
from O
pension O
plans O
to O
be O
included O
as O
\u201cother O
sources\u201d O
and O
reduce O
awards O
when O
received O
by O
non-dependents. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
exception O
cannot O
apply O
to O
the O
receipt O
of O
funds O
by O
Willie O
J. O
Patterson O
and O
any O
award O
should O
be O
reduced O
by O
the O
full O
amount O
paid O
by O
the O
Fund O
. O
In O
relation O
to O
James O
Patterson O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
record O
to O
indicate O
that O
he O
did O
not O
advance O
$500 O
for O
the O
funeral O
expenses. O
The O
$500 O
payment O
was O
made O
prior O
to O
the O
$3 O
, O
839 O
payment O
by O
the O
Fund. O
There O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
record O
that O
indicates O
James O
Patterson O
was O
obligated O
to O
pay O
the O
additional O
$3 O
, O
339 O
in O
funeral O
expenses. O
The O
issue O
becomes O
more O
complex O
by O
virtue O
of O
the O
awards O
made O
and O
warrants O
delivered O
to O
James O
Patterson O

The O

is O
an O
often-heard O
issue O
in O

is O
perhaps O
the O
hardest O
issue O
this O
Court O
must O
consider. O
In O

has O
died O
and O
generally O
his O
widow O
or O

are O
seeking O

under O

It O
is O
very O
difficult O
not O
to O
be O
sympathetic O
to O
the O
Claimants O
in O
these O
cases O
but O
as O
a O
Court O
, O
the O
case O

clear O
that O
the O
issues O
are O
to O
be O

the O
facts O

each O
case O
, O
and O
we O
as O
a O
Court O
put O
sympathy O
aside O
. O
This O
case O
is O
particularly O
difficult. O
The O
report O
of O
the O

indicated O
the O
following O
facts O
which O
are O
not O

, O

, O
Gaiy O

at O

Special O

The O

General O
believed O
that O

the O

, O
Special O

Degelman O
was O
not O
engaged O

place O
him O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty O

The O

that O
immediately O
prior O

, O
Special O

the O
bed O
of O
a O
moving O
pick-up O
truck O
guarding O
metal O
shelving O
units O
belonging O
to O
Captain O

so O
that O
they O
would O
not O
fall O
from O
the O
truck O
as O
they O
had O
earlier O
. O

use O
a O
pickup O
truck O
of O
the O
Illinois O
State O
Police O
as O
one O
of O
the O
surveillance O
vehicles O
because O
it O
was O
equipped O
with O
a O
two-way O

(i) O
Before O

, O
a O
second O

be O
in O

given O
their O
duty O

as O
well; O
*261(j) O
Special O
Agent O
Knicl O
was O
assigned O
the O
duty O
of O
attempting O
to O
make O
a O
hand-to-hand O
purchase O
of O
narcotics O
from O
the O
suspect O
at O
70 O
N. O
Yorktown O
Road O
, O
Macomb O
, O
Illinois O
, O
to O
be O

a O
portion O
of O

which O
Master O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
and O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
obtained O
from O
the O
bank O
in O
preparation O
for O
the O
planned O
police O
operation. O
Inspector O
Shirey O
was O
assigned O
the O
duty O
to O
transport O
the O
confidential O
source O
to O
his O
undercover O
car O
and O
adopt O
a O
roving O
surveillance O
position O
in O
support O
of O
the O
narcotics O
investigation; O
(k) O
After O
the O
duty O
assignments O
were O
made O
, O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
and O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
left O
108 O
Bar O
si O
Street O
and O
returned O
to O
10 O
Richmond O
Road O
where O
they O
loaded O
a O
TV O
set O
, O
a O
chair O
, O
and O
two O
metal O
shelving O
units O
in O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
State O
police O
truck O
, O
and O
the O
vehicle O
was O
then O
parked O
on O
North O
Yorktown O
Road O
near O
the O
front O
of O
the O
Herrick O
residence. O
Since O
the O
suspects O
had O
previously O
been O
observed O
entering O
the O
residence O
at O
70 O
N. O
Yorktown O
, O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
then O
repeatedly O
attempted O
to O
reach O
Special O
Agent O
Knicl O
by O
State O
police O
radio O
to O
advise O
him O
to O
proceed O
with O
the O
planned O
narcotics O
purchase; O
(l) O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
and O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
received O
no O
responsive O
communication O
from O
Special O
Agent O
Knicl O
, O
and O
after O
a O
time O
, O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
concluded O
that O
radio O
communication O
was O
ineffective O
because O
their O
location O
was O
in O
a O
deep O
valley O
on O
the O
westerly O
side O
of O
Macomb O
, O
Illinois. O
Comrie O
decided O
to O
move O
to O
a O
higher O
location O
and O
drove O
the O
truck O
out O
of O
the O
valley O
up O
a O
hill O
to O
the O
east. O
On O
May O
4 O
, O
1989 O
, O
gusty O
winds O
were O
blowing O
from O
12-22 O
miles O
per O
hour O
at O
Macomb O
, O
Illinois. O
At O
that O
time O
a O
gust O
of O
wind O
blew O
one O
of O
the O
metal O
shelving O
units O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
pick-up O
truck. O
They O
stopped O
and O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
placed O
the O
shelving O
unit O
back O
into O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
truck O
and O
advised O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
that O
he O
would O
ride O
in O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
truck O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
stabilize O
the O
load; O
*262(m) O
Communication O
with O
Special O
Agent O
Knicl O
was O
achieved O
after O
the O
State O
police O
truck O
reached O
the O
high O
ground. O
The O
sergeant O
then O
directed O
Knicl O
to O
proceed O
to O
70 O
N. O
Yorktown O
Road O
and O
notified O
Inspector O
Shirey O
, O
another O
surveillance O
officer O
, O
that O
he O
had O
moved O
the O
truck O
from O
the O
close O
surveillance O
position O
and O
directed O
Shirey O
to O
move O
from O
his O
roving O
surveillance O
position O
to O
the O
primary O
position O
where O
the O
pick-up O
truck O
had O
been O
parked; O
(n) O
Sergeant O
Comrie O
and O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
performed O
the O
roving O
surveillance O
duties O
initially O
assigned O
to O
Inspector O
Shirey O
and O
while O
driving O
in O
the O
vicinity O
of O
West O
Jackson O
Street O
in O
Macomb O
, O
Illinois O
, O
on O
May O
4 O
, O
1989 O
, O
at O
4:00 O
p.m. O
, O
another O
gust O
of O
wind O
caused O
the O
shelving O
units O
to O
be O
blown O
about O
, O
at O
which O
time O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
, O
who O
was O
crouched O
down O
in O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
surveillance O
truck O
, O
endeavored O
to O
keep O
the O
shelving O
units O
from O
blowing O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
truck O
at O
which O
time O
he O
accidentally O
fell O
backwards O
from O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
surveillance O
truck O
and O
struck O
his O
head O
on O
the O
pavement O
, O
thereby O
incurring O
severe O
closed O
head O
injuries O
including O
a O
severed O
brain O
stem O
which O
resulted O
in O
his O
death; O
(o) O
The O
narcotics O
purchase O
from O
the O
suspect O
was O
accomplished O
shortly O
after O
4:05 O
p.m. O
on O
May O
4 O
, O
1989 O
, O
when O
Special O
Agent O
Knicl O
entered O
the O
Herrick O
residence. O
The O
accident O
, O
which O
occurred O
during O
the O
roving O
surveillance O
, O
occurred O
a O
few O
minutes O
before O
Special O
Agent O
Knicl O
entered O
the O
Herrick O
residence. O
The O
hand-to-hand O
narcotics O
purchase O
resulted O
in O
a O
conviction O
of O
Herrick; O
(p) O
Captain O
Collins O
was O
suspended O
for O
60 O
days O
for O
his O
actions; O
(q) O
That O
Captain O
Collins O
violated O
the O
rules O
of O
conduct O
of O
the O
Illinois O
State O
Police O
by O
authorizing O
Illinois O
State O
Police O
officers O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
move O
of O
his O
personal O
*263belongings O
while O
on O
Illinois O
State O
Police O
time O
and O
while O
utilizing O
an O
official O
Illinois O
State O
Police O
vehicle; O
(r) O
That O
the O
officers O
, O
including O
the O
decedent O
, O
were O
engaged O
in O
surveillance O
activities O
in O
aid O
of O
a O
drug O
enforcement O
buy; O
(s) O
That O
the O
route O
taken O
by O
the O
truck O
just O
prior O
to O
Agent O
Degelman O
falling O
from O
the O
truck O
was O
exactly O
the O
same O
route O
being O
taken O
to O
deliver O
the O
furniture O
to O
Captain O
Collins\u2019 O
new O
apartment O
. O
It O
is O
apparent O
to O
the O
Court O
from O
the O
sworn O
testimony O
provided O
by O
Claimant O
that O
there O
are O
no O
material O
issues O
of O
fact. O
Even O
though O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
was O
moving O
the O
property O
of O
Captain O
Collins O
in O
violation O
of O
rules O
of O
the O
Illinois O
State O
Police O
, O
he O
was O
doing O
so O
pursuant O
to O
orders O
and O
as O
part O
of O
a O
drug O
surveillance. O
There O
is O
no O
question O
that O
as O
part O
of O
the O
surveillance O
, O
Agent O
Degelman O
was O
carrying O
out O
the O
ruse O
of O
being O
a O
mover O
of O
personal O
property. O
It O
is O
impossible O
to O
separate O
the O
two O
activities O
as O
the O
Respondent O
argues O
because O
the O
two O
activities O
were O
so O
interrelated. O
However O
poorly O
thought O
out O
the O
plan O
, O
however O
much O
Comrie O
and O
Collins O
must O
accept O
their O
role O
in O
the O
death O
of O
Agent O
Degelman O
, O
the O
fact O
remains O
that O
Agent O
Degelman O
was O
on O
duty O
and O
doing O
his O
duty O
as O
ordered. O
We O
find O
there O
are O
no O
material O
issues O
of O
fact O
and O
that O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman O
was O
killed O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty O
albeit O
a O
duty O
in O
violation O
of O
department O
rules O
and O
regulations. O
The O
Claimant O
is O
therefore O
entitled O
to O
summary O
judgment O
. O
We O
find O
that O
there O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
circumstances O
to O
indicate O
that O
Special O
Agent O
Degelman\u2019s O
death O
was O
caused O
by O
willful O
misconduct O
or O
intoxication. O
He O
did O
not O
order O
the O
conduct. O
It O
was O
ordered O
by O
his O
superior. O
We O
further O
find O
that O
the O
foregoing O
circumstances O
fall O
within O
the O
terms O
and O
provisions O
of O
the O
Law O
Enforcement O

We O
must O

not O
find O
a O

This O

Claimant O
to O

The O
Court O
, O
after O
review O
of O
the O
claim O
and O
the O
investigatory O
report O
issued O
by O
the O
Attorney O
General O
, O
issued O
an O
opinion O
on O
July O
22 O
, O
1989 O
, O
denying O
the O
claim. O
The O
Court O
found O
that O
the O
Claimant O
and O
a O
companion O
initiated O
a O
series O
of O
fights O
with O
third O
persons O
that O
led O
to O
Claimants O
injuries. O
The O
Court O
also O
found O
that O
Claimant O
notified O
law O
enforcement O
officials O
11 O
days O
after O
the O
perpetration O
of O
the O
incident O
and O
failed O
to O
establish O
that O
such O
notification O
was O
timely O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O
Claimant O
seeks O
reimbursement O
for O
out-of-pocket O
medical O
expenses O
and O
loss O
of O
earnings. O
The O
sum O
sought O
is O
in O
excess O
of O
the O
maximum O
award O
allowed O
by O
the O
Act. O
Claimant O
was O
employed O
full O
time O
by O
the O
fire O
department O
of O
the O
City O
of O
Chicago O
prior O
to O
his O
injury O
and O
worked O
occasionally O
as O
a O
stagehand O
. O
*592On O
August O
17 O
, O
1989 O
, O
Claimant O
filed O
a O
petition O
for O
hearing. O
A O
hearing O
was O
conducted O
at O
which O
Claimant O
and O
a O
witness O
on O
behalf O
of O
Claimant O
, O
David O
Sears O
, O
testified. O
Claimant O
was O
represented O
by O
counsel. O
Ten O
exhibits O
were O
offered O
into O
evidence O
by O
the O
Claimant. O
All O
ten O
were O
admitted O
without O
objection O
. O
Claimant O
testified O
, O
under O
oath O
, O
that O
on O
the O
day O
in O
question O
he O
and O
David O
Sears O
stopped O
at O
a O
bar O
to O
wait O
for O
a O
ride O
from O
Claimants O
girlfriend. O
On O
that O
day O
he O
and O
Sears O
had O
been O
working O
as O
stagehands O
and O
he O
had O
his O
tool O
bag O
with O
him. O
All O
of O
the O
tools O
possessed O
by O
the O
two O
were O
in O
the O
tool O
bags O
at O
all O
times O
. O
The O
two O
were O
at O
the O
bar O
for O
approximately O
30 O
to O
35 O
minutes O
and O
were O
drinking O
their O
second O
beer O
when O
Claimant O
heard O
several O
individuals O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
bar O
making O
racial O
slurs. O
As O
the O
Claimant O
and O
Sears O
started O
to O
leave O
the O
bar O
, O
one O
of O
the O
individuals O
blocked O
their O
path. O
Claimant O
told O
the O
individuals O
that O
he O
and O
Sears O
did O
not O
want O
any O
trouble O
and O
only O
wanted O
to O
leave. O
The O
individual O
, O
whom O
Claimant O
later O
learned O
was O
Lavelle O
Cross O
, O
said O
to O
\u201chang O
around O
for O
awhile\u201d O
or O
\u201cyou O
ain\u2019t O
going O
nowhere.\u201d O
Claimant O
stated O
that O
he O
did O
not O
respond O
to O
Cross O
but O
asked O
the O
bartender O
to O
call O
the O
police O
and O
she O
refused. O
Another O
individual O
, O
Joseph O
Pinney O
, O
was O
next O
to O
Cross. O
Neither O
Claimant O
or O
Sears O
made O
any O
aggressive O
moves O
towards O
Cross O
or O
Pinney O
. O
Claimant O
and O
Sears O
left O
the O
bar O
several O
minutes O
after O
the O
verbal O
exchange. O
As O
the O
two O
entered O
the O
street O
, O
Cross O
and O
Pinney O
and O
a O
third O
individual O
followed O
them O
out O
of O
the O
bar. O
Sears O
started O
running O
and O
Claimant O
ran O
across O
the O
street O
to O
the O
Medinah O
Building O
to O
seek O
some O
protection. O
He O
dropped O
his O
tool O
bag O
approximately O
50 O
feet O
from O
the O
door O
to O
the O
building O
and O
found O
the O
doors O
locked. O
Cross O
and O
Pinney O
grabbed O
Claimant O
by O
both O
arms O
and O
threw O
him O
into O
and O
through O
a O
plate O
glass O
door O
. O
*593Claimant O
stated O
that O
neither O
he O
or O
Sears O
held O
a O
hammer O
or O
any O
other O
tool O
that O
could O
be O
considered O
a O
weapon. O
He O
did O
not O
have O
a O
chance O
to O
turn O
around O
and O
defend O
himself O
or O
to O
fight O
off O
his O
attackers. O
He O
was O
knocked O
unconscious O
in O
the O
attack O
. O
Claimant O
suffered O
extremely O
severe O
injuries O
to O
his O
left O
upper O
extremity O
which O
nearly O
resulted O
in O
the O
loss O
of O
the O
upper O
extremity O
and O
his O
life. O
The O
injury O
included O
multiple O
tendon O
, O
artery O
, O
nerve O
and O
muscle O
injuries O
as O
indicated O
by O
Claimants O
exhibits O
. O
After O
the O
incident O
Claimant O
was O
taken O
by O
ambulance O
to O
the O
hospital O
and O
received O
emergency O
surgery. O
The O
day O
Claimant O
came O
out O
of O
intensive O
care O
, O
11 O
days O
after O
the O
incident O
, O
he O
reported O
the O
crime O
to O
the O
police. O
He O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
three O
to O
four O
weeks. O
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
he O
was O
receiving O
vast O
amounts O
of O
pain-killing O
drugs O
, O
i.e. O
, O
morphine O
and O
darvon. O
Claimants O
exhibit O
number O
1 O
is O
a O
letter O
from O
Daniel O
J. O
Nogles O
, O
M.D. O
, O
in O
which O
it O
is O
stated O
that O
Claimant O
nearly O
lost O
his O
life O
and O
was O
in O
no O
condition O
to O
communicate O
with O
anyone O
during O
the O
majority O
of O
his O
hospitalization. O
Based O
upon O
the O
evidence O
relating O
to O
Claimant\u2019s O
physical O
and O
mental O
inability O
to O
report O
the O
crime O
because O
of O
his O
injuries O
, O
the O
Court O
finds O
that O
Claimant O
has O
established O
that O
notification O
to O
police O
was O
reasonable O
under O
the O
circumstances O
. O
David O
Sears\u2019 O
testimony O
corroborated O
Claimant\u2019s O
version O
of O
the O
incident O
, O
and O
confirmed O
that O
he O
and O
Claimant O
were O
attacked O
without O
having O
provoked O
the O
incident O
. O
The O
Respondent O
did O
not O
produce O
any O
witnesses O
but O
did O
tender O
a O
12-page O
group O
exhibit O
purporting O
to O
be O
the O
October O
10 O
, O
1987 O
, O
police O
report O
which O
was O
admitted O
into O
the O
record O
without O
objection O
. O
*594The O
Attorney O
Generals O
investigatory O
report O
filed O
with O
the O
Court O
prior O
to O
its O
July O
22 O
, O
1989 O
opinion O
, O
included O
a O
conclusion O
that O
Claimant O
and O
a O
companion O
verbally O
harassed O
one O
of O
the O
offenders O
, O
struck O
the O
offender O
with O
a O
hammer O
and O
initiated O
another O
fight. O
The O
Court O
apparently O
relied O
upon O
this O
factual O
conclusion O
, O
along O
with O
the O
statement O
in O
the O
investigatory O
report O
that O
the O
conduct O
of O
Claimant O
directly O
contributed O
to O
his O
injury O
, O
in O
issuing O
its O
opinion O
denying O
the O
claim O
. O
During O
the O
hearing O
, O
the O
Assistant O
Attorney O
General O
indicated O
that O
the O
Respondent O
, O
in O
preparing O
and O
filing O
the O
investigatory O
report O
, O
only O
reviewed O
the O
police O
report O
arising O
out O
of O
the O
incident. O
A O
review O
of O
the O
police O
report O
indicates O
that O
approximately O
seven O
witnesses O
were O
interviewed O
and O
the O
three O
most O
relevant O
are O
Claimant O
, O
Sears O
and O
Robert O
Harris O
, O
the O
night O
watchman O
at O
the O
Medinah O
Building. O
The O
interview O
with O
Harris O
indicates O
that O
Claimant O
voluntarily O
left O
the O
Medinah O
Building O
with O
a O
hammer O
in O
his O
hand O
to O
face O
Cross O
and O
Finney. O
The O
Harris O
interview O
does O
not O
directly O
dispute O
any O
other O
portion O
of O
Claimant\u2019s O
testimony O
. O
The O
police O
report O
, O
except O
for O
the O
interviews O
with O
Cross O
and O
Finney O
, O
does O
not O
tend O
to O
prove O
that O
Claimant O
initiated O
or O
provoked O
the O
altercation. O
Claimant\u2019s O
exhibit O
numbers O
4 O
and O

, O
for O
the O

arising O
out O
of O

. O
Based O
upon O

of O
Claimant O
and O
his O
companion O
, O
and O
the O
proof O
of O
convictions O
of O

and O

, O
this O
Court O
finds O
that O
Claimant O
did O
not O
initiate O
the O
altercation O
and O
therefore O
did O
not O
directly O
contribute O
to O
his O
injury O
. O
The O

The O

, O
loss O
of O

and O

because O
of O

resulting O
from O

The O
same O
section O
specifies O
that O
an O
award O
for O
loss O
of O
earnings O
or O
future O
earnings O
is O
to O
be O
determined O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
the O

or O
on O

, O

per O

, O
whichever O
is O
less. O
In O
this O
instance O
, O
Claimant O
demonstrated O
six O
months O
of O
earnings O
from O
his O
primary O
job O
as O
a O
fireman O
prior O
to O
the O
date O
of O
injury. O
The O
sum O
of O
$1 O

per O
month O
is O
the O
lesser O
amount O
to O
be O
used O
to O
calculate O
earnings O

for O
Claimant O
. O
Claimant O
was O
injured O
on O
September O
29 O
, O
1987 O
, O
and O
was O
earning O
$2 O
, O
703.50 O
per O
month O
as O
an O
employee O
of O
the O
Chicago O
Fire O
Department. O
He O
was O
on O
personal O
disability O
leave O
from O
his O
job O
for O
a O
period O
of O
12 O
months O
following O
the O
incident O
and O
received O
his O
earnings O
in O
full O
from O
the O
fire O
department. O
Therefore O
, O
Claimant O
did O
not O
lose O
any O
earnings O
in O
the O
12 O
months O
following O
the O
injury O
, O
except O
for O
what O
he O
might O
have O
earned O
in O
his O
second O
job O
as O
a O
stagehand. O
His O
Federal O
tax O
returns O
indicate O
that O
he O
earned O
$787 O
in O
1987 O
and O
$2 O
, O
369 O
in O
1988 O
from O
his O
stagehand O
work. O
The O
only O
conclusion O
which O
can O
be O
drawn O
is O
that O
he O
had O
more O
earnings O
from O
his O
stagehand O
job O
in O
the O
calendar O
year O
after O
the O
incident. O
No O
tax O
return O
for O
1989 O
was O
provided. O
There O
is O
insufficient O
documentation O
of O
his O
earnings O
from O
his O
stagehand O
work O
to O
warrant O
an O
award O
of O
loss O
of O
earnings O
. O
Additionally O
, O
it O
is O
noted O
that O
the O
1988 O
Federal O
tax O
return O
shows O
he O
received O
a O
$15 O
, O
000 O
sum O
from O
a O
Nationwide O
Life O
Insurance O
policy O
. O
On O
November O
30 O
, O
1988 O
, O
14 O
months O
after O
the O
incident O
, O
the O
retirement O
board O
of O
Firemens O
Annuity O
and O
Benefit O
Fund O
of O
Chicago O
notified O
Claimant O
that O
he O
was O
granted O
ordinary O
disability O
benefits O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$1 O
, O
119.51 O
a O
month O
beginning O
September O
28 O
, O
1988 O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
removed O
from O
the O
Chicago O
Fire O
Department O
payroll O
effective O
September O
29. O
The O
sum O
of O
$110 O
was O
to O
be O
deducted O
from O
his O
benefits O
for O
his O
health O
insurance O
premium O
. O
On O
November O
17 O
, O
1989 O
, O
Claimant O
was O
notified O
by O
the O
board O
that O
he O
was O
found O
unfit O
for O
duty O
and O
his O
benefits O
*599would O
be O
continued O
for O
another O
year. O
A O
July O
17 O
, O
1990 O
, O
letter O
from O
the O
board O
indicates O
that O
Claimant O
would O
receive O
a O
monthly O
grant O
of O
$1 O
, O
009.51 O
until O
January O
17 O
, O
1993 O
. O
Section O
2(h) O
of O
the O
Act O
specifies O
that O
the O
loss O
of O
future O
earnings O
shall O
be O
reduced O
by O
any O
income O
from O
substitute O
work O
actually O
performed O
by O
the O

or O
by O
income O
he O
would O
have O

in O
available O
appropriate O
substitute O
work O
he O
was O
capable O
of O
performing O
but O
unreasonably O
failed O
to O
undertake O
. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
has O
had O
some O
employment O
as O
a O
stagehand O
since O
the O
date O
of O
his O
injury. O
His O
grasp O
and O
strength O
of O
his O
left O
arm O
do O
not O
permit O
him O
to O
work O
as O
a O
stagehand O
like O
he O
did O
prior O
to O
the O
accident. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
other O
efforts O
by O
Claimant O
in O
attempting O
to O
secure O
appropriate O
substitute O
work O
. O
Claimants O
disability O
benefit O
does O
give O
him O
less O
income O
than O
his O
pay O
from O
the O
fire O
department. O
But O
, O
the O
claimed O
loss O
of O
future O
earnings O
because O
of O
his O
disability O
needs O
to O
be O
reduced O
by O
income O
earned O
in O
available O
appropriate O
substitute O
work O
he O
was O
capable O
of O
performing O
but O
unreasonably O
failed O
to O
undertake. O
See O
section O
2(h) O
of O
the O
Act O
. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
did O
some O
stagehand O
work O
after O
his O
injury; O
therefore O
, O
it O
was O
demonstrated O
that O
he O
was O
capable O
of O
performing O
some O
substitute O
work. O
He O
did O
not O
demonstrate O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
perform O
additional O
substitute O
work. O
The O
finding O
of O
disability O
by O
the O
retirement O
board O
was O
that O
he O
was O
unfit O
for O
duty O
as O
a O
fireman. O
There O
were O
no O
findings O
or O
proof O
offered O
that O
Claimant O
is O
completely O
and O
permanently O
disabled O
and O
incapable O
of O
performing O
any O
work. O
Claimant O
has O
failed O
to O
establish O
that O
he O
experienced O
a O
loss O
of O
earnings O
making O
him O
eligible O
for O
an O
award O
, O
after O
the O
board O
granted O
him O
ordinary O
disability O
benefits O
effective O
September O
29 O
, O
1988 O
. O
*600We O
find O
that O
Claimants O
petition O
for O
loss O
of O
earnings O

is O

denied. O
Claimant O
unreasonably O
failed O

was O
capable O
of O
performing O
, O
or O
to O
demonstrate O
that O
he O
was O
incapable O
of O
performing O
any O
work. O
Claimant O
did O
not O
provide O
evidence O
relating O
to O
his O
income O
in O
1989; O
therefore O
, O
he O
has O
failed O
to O

that O
any O
sum O
would O
be O
due O

He O
described O
the O
six O

that O
the O

His O
testimony O
in O

to O
check O
number O
194 O
, O
check O
number O
152 O
, O
and O
check O
number O
180 O
was O
consistent O
with O
his O
explanation O
of O
the O
one O
in O
the O
300 O
series O
. O
On O
cross-examination O
, O
Claimant O
acknowledged O
that O
1993 O
was O
the O
only O
year O
his O
adjusted O
gross O
income O
was O
under O
$12 O
, O
000. O
He O
is O
not O
currently O
working O
but O
is O
trying O
to O
get O
a O
landscaping O
job. O
He O
is O
still O
under O
the O
care O
of O
doctors. O
He O
did O
not O
file O
a O
civil O
suit O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
incident O
. O
Claimant O
was O
receiving O
annuity O
benefits O
from O
the O
firemans O
fund O
until O
1993. O
He O
has O
not O
received O
those O
benefits O
since O
1993. O
On O
line O
17-B O
of O
his O
1989 O
tax O
return O
, O
$13 O
, O
433 O
was O
reported O
from O
the O
firemans O
annuity. O
This O
is O
his O
pension. O
The O
approximate O
sums O
also O
appear O
on O
line O
17-B O
of O
his O
1991 O
and O
1992 O
Federal O
tax O
returns. O
He O
received O
nearly O
$40 O
, O
000 O
in O
pension O
payments. O
In O
the O
1993 O
Federal O
tax O
return O
the O
sum O
of O
$578 O
appears O
because O
he O
exhausted O
the O
benefits O
available O
to O
him O
under O
his O
pension. O
He O
will O
not O
receive O
any O
retirement O
payments. O
He O
had O
not O
filed O
a O
1994 O
Federal O
tax O
return O
at O
the O
time O
of O
rehearing O
. O
*604The O
first O
year O
after O
the O
incident O
, O
Claimant O
received O
full O
pay O
from O
the O
fire O
department. O
Then O
the O
retirement O
board O
met O
and O
determined O
he O
was O
disabled. O
He O
began O
receiving O
$1 O
, O
009.58 O
per O
month. O
The O
retirement O
board O
determined O
each O
year O
, O
through O
1992 O
, O
that O
Claimant O
was O
still O
unfit O
to O
perform O
the O
duties O
of O
a O
fireman O
. O
Claimant O
received O
$5 O
, O
000 O
of O
unemployment O
benefits O
in O
1989. O
None O
of O
his O
medical O
or O
hospital O
creditors O
represented O
by O

numbers O
S-5 O
through O
S-17 O
have O
filed O
a O
lawsuit O
to O
collect O
the O
sums O
owed O
. O
In O

to O
the O
payments O
made O
with O
checks O
wherein O
the O

\u201cSonnenberg\u201d O
was O
on O

of O
the O
check O
, O
no O
bills O
were O
provided O
which O
would O
show O
that O

were O
provided O
to O
Claimant. O
Claimant O
was O
instructed O
that O
the O
record O
would O
remain O
open O
for O
30 O
days O
after O
the O
rehearing O
and O
he O
could O
file O
any O
documents O
he O
desired O
. O
Claimant O
believed O
that O
he O
would O
have O
received O
continuing O
disability O
payments O
and O
a O
pension O
if O
he O
had O
ten O
years O
on O
the O
fire O
department. O
Instead O
, O
he O
only O
had O
eight O
years O
and O
the O
retirement O
board O
refunded O
his O
pension O
contributions O
over O
three O
and O
one-half O
years. O
Claimant O
was O
granted O
leave O
to O
supplement O
the O
record O
with O
information O
from O
the O
Fireman\u2019s O
Annuity O
and O
Benefit O
Fund. O
The O
Commissioner O
inquired O
whether O
there O
was O
any O
type O
of O
work O
that O
Claimant O
could O
do O
, O
i.e. O
, O
working O
at O
a O
convenience O
store. O
It O
was O
also O
suggested O
that O
Claimant O
provide O
specific O
information O
on O
his O
efforts O
at O
finding O
a O
job O
, O
i.e. O
, O
dates O
and O
names O
of O
companies O
. O
Claimant O
applied O
for O
disability O
with O
the O
Social O
Security O
Administration O
and O
for O
supplemental O
social O
security O
but O
was O
denied O
. O
On O
April O
12 O
, O
1995 O
, O
Claimant\u2019s O
counsel O
provided O
a O
March O
27 O
, O
1995 O
letter O
from O
the O
Retirement O
Board O
of O
the O
*605Firemans O
Annuity O

Benefit O
Fund O
of O
Chicago O
, O
and O
an O
affidavit O
of O
Claimant O
, O
dated O
April O
24 O
, O
1995 O
, O
which O
stated O
his O
efforts O
to O
secure O
employment. O
The O
two O
documents O
were O
marked O
as O
exhibits O
and O
became O
part O
of O
the O
record. O
Claimant O
has O
not O
filed O
a O
brief O
. O
The O
March O
27 O
, O
1995 O
letter O
indicates O
that O
Claimant O
was O
employed O
by O
the O
Chicago O
Fire O
Department O
on O
February O
18 O
, O
1980 O
, O
and O
was O
so O
employed O
until O
September O
29 O
, O
1988 O
, O
at O
which O
time O
he O
went O
on O
ordinary O
disability O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$1 O
, O
199.51 O
per O
month O
through O
January O
16 O
, O
1993 O
, O
when O
his O
benefit O
expired. O
It O
states O
further O
that O
this O
benefit O
was O
not O
a O
deduction O
from O
future O
benefits O
nor O
was O
it O
deferred O
compensation. O
He O
was O
reinstated O
to O
the O
Chicago O
Fire O
Department O
on O
April O
16 O
, O
1993 O
, O
through O
June O
1 O
, O
1993 O
, O
which O
was O
his O
date O
of O
discharge. O
For O
pension O
purposes O
, O
accumulated O
service O
credits O
amount O
to O
13 O
years O
and O
nine O
days. O
As O
of O
the O
date O
of O
the O
letter O
, O
Claimant O
had O
two O
options: O
collect O
a O
pension O
at O
age O
50 O
in O
the O
monthly O
amount O
of O
$475 O
or O
take O
a O
refund O
of O
his O
contributions O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$39 O
, O
584.21 O
. O
The O
affidavit O
provided O
by O
Claimant O
listed O
23 O
different O
companies O
where O
he O
made O
efforts O
toward O
seeking O
employment. O
No O
dates O
of O
when O
the O
efforts O
were O

are O
stated O
in O

FINDINGS O
The O
record O
is O
inconsistent O
in O
relation O
to O
whether O
Claimant O
received O
disability O
payments O
or O
a O
return O
of O
his O
pension O
funds O
from O
1989 O
through O
1993. O
He O
testified O
that O
it O
was O
the O
return O
of O
his O
pension. O
However O
, O
the O
documents O
provided O
indicate O
that O
Claimant O
was O
receiving O
disability O
payments. O
In O
addition O
, O
he O
apparently O
received O
unemployment O
compensation O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
$5 O
, O
000 O
in O
1989 O
, O
which O
was O
at O
the O
same O
time O
he O
was O
receiving O
disability O
payments. O
The O
State O
of O
Illinois O
may O
have O
a O
claim O
against O
him O
*606for O
a O
set-off O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
unemployment O
compensation O
received O
. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
rehearing O
was O
to O
allow O
the O
Claimant O
to O
supplement O
the O
record O
on O
his O
continuing O
disability O
and O
inability O
to O
obtain O
substitute O
employment. O
Claimant O
has O
supplemented O
the O
record O
, O
however O
, O
we O
find O
that O
Claimant O
is O
not O
entitled O
to O
an O
award O
for O
loss O
of O
earnings O
or O
loss O
of O
future O
earnings. O
Claimant O
received O
his O
salary O
or O
disability O
payments O
from O
the O
Firemans O
Fund O
in O
excess O
of O
the O
$1 O
, O
000 O
monthly O
maximum O
specified O
in O
the O
Act. O
Claimant O
applied O
for O
disability O
with O
the O
Social O
Security O
Administration O
and O
for O
supplemental O
social O
security O
but O
was O
denied O
benefits. O
More O
importantly O
, O
no O
expert O
evidence O
has O
ever O
been O
provided O
to O
indicate O
that O
Claimant O
is O
now O
physically O
unable O
to O
work. O
The O
purpose O
of O
the O
Act O
is O
not O
to O
provide O
relief O
for O
persons O
who O
are O
unable O
to O
find O
employment O
after O
suffering O
injuries O
, O
but O
is O
to O
compensate O
those O
persons O
who O
are O
unable O
to O
work O
because O
of O
injuries O
suffered O
from O
a O
violent O
crime. O
In O
this O
instance O
, O
Claimant O
has O
not O
demonstrated O
that O
he O
is O
unable O
to O
find O
work O
because O
of O
his O
injuries O
. O
In O
relation O
to O
compensation O
for O
medical O
and O
hospital O
expenses O
, O
the O
Courts O
prior O
award O
of O
$560.75 O
shall O
stand. O
Although O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
rehearing O
was O
for O
consideration O
of O
continuing O
disability O
and O
inability O
to O
find O
work O
, O
Claimant O
supplemented O
the O
record O
with O
13 O
different O
bills/statements O
from O
medical O
and O
health O
providers O
indicating O
that O
he O
still O
personally O
owes O
money. O
This O
evidence O
was O
not O
provided O
in O
the O
initial O
hearing. O
Exhibit O
number O
S-17 O
indicates O
that O
the O
provider O
wrote O
off O
the O
amounts O
owed O
as O
a O
bad O
debt. O
All O
of O
the O
other O
bills/statements O
are O
dated O
six O
or O
seven O
years O
prior O
to O
the O
hearing O
date. O
Although O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
still O
owes O
those O
sums O
, O
he O
did O
not O
provide O
any O
independent O
evidence O
that O
the O
providers O
are O
still O
seeking O
payment O
. O
*607Based O
upon O
the O
evidence O
provided O
at O
the O
rehearing O
and O
documents O
supplementing O
the O
record O
, O
the O
Courts O
award O
of O
$560.75 O
shall O
stand O
and O
Claimants O
requests O
for O
additional O
compensation O
are O

The O
Court O
previously O
denied O
the O
claim O
in O
its O
order O
of O
December O
16 O
, O
1994. O
The O
Court O
found O
, O
based O
on O
the O
investigatory O
report O
, O
that O
the O
victims O
conduct O
contributed O
to O
*660his O
death O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
as O
to O
warrant O
that O
the O
Claimant O
be O
denied O
entitlement O
to O
compensation. O
The O
Court O
found O
that O
the O
incident O
occurred O
due O
to O
tire O
fact O
that O
the O
victim O
and O
the O
offender O
were O
members O
of O
opposing O
street O
gangs O
and O
the O
death O
occurred O
as O
a O
result O
of O
their O
gang O
affiliation O
, O
gang O
rivalry O
, O
and O
face-to-face O
provocation O
. O
The O
Claimant O
filed O
a O
timely O
request O
for O
hearing O
and O
the O
cause O
was O
tried O
before O
Commissioner O
Michael O
Kane. O
The O
evidence O
presented O
shows O
that O
while O
tire O
investigation O
completed O
by O
the O
Attorney O
General O
suggests O
that O
street O
gang O
affiliation O
had O
some O
connection O
to O
this O
shooting O
, O
a O
more O
thorough O
examination O
of O
the O
facts O
reveals O
that O
the O
decedent O
had O
not O
been O
involved O
in O
any O
street O
gang O
activity O
for O
some O
years O
prior O
to O
the O
shooting. O
The O
Claimant O
, O
the O
grandmother O
of O
Victor O
E. O
Ramirez O
, O
applied O
for O
compensation O
, O
specifically O
, O
funeral O
expenses O
and O
loss O
of O
support O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
shooting O
death O
of O
Mr. O
Ramirez O
on O
September O
18 O
, O
1993. O
Evidence O
was O
elicited O
at O
the O
hearing O
which O
established O
the O
following O
facts: O
the O
victim O
, O
Victor O
Ramirez O
, O
in O
his O
high O
school O
days O
, O
was O
in O
fact O
a O
member O
of O
a O
street O
gang; O
on O
the O
date O
of O
the O
shooting O
, O
he O
was O
not O
involved O
in O
any O
gang O
activity O
, O
but O
simply O
was O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
at O
the O
wrong O
time. O
The O
individual O
who O
shot O
Mr. O
Ramirez O
, O
Darvin O
Williams O
, O
did O
not O
know O
the O
victim. O
However O
, O
in O
a O
confession O
to O
police O
he O
did O
admit O
shooting O
victim O
Ramirez O
simply O
because O
Mr. O
Ramirez O
was O
with O
an O
individual O
who O
Williams O
thought O
to O
be O
a O
member O
of O
a O
gang. O
The O
victim O
had O
not O
been O
involved O
in O
any O
gang O
activity O
since O
his O
high O
school O
days O
and O
was O
working. O
Furthermore O
, O
he O
had O
been O
through O
the O
TASC O
program O
and O
a O
counselor O
had O
found O
him O
a O
job O
parking O
cars O
. O
Because O
the O
evidence O
presented O
indicated O
that O
the O
decedent O
had O
previously O
left O
the O
Latin O
Kings O
street O
gang O
, O
we O
find O
our O
previous O
findings O
to O
be O
in O
error. O
A O
close O
examination O
of O
the O
evidence O
shows O
that O
the O
decedent O
did O
*661nothing O
to O
provoke O
his O
own O
injury. O
Prior O
to O
the O
shooting O
, O
the O
Claimants O
decedent O
was O
merely O
seated O
on O
a O
step. O
He O
did O
not O
show O
any O
gang O
signs O
, O
gang O
clothing O
or O
shout O
gang O
slogans. O
The O
decedent O
was O
not O
a O
gang O
member O
on O
the O
date O
of O
his O
death O
. O
This O
Court O
has O
taken O
a O
strong O
stance O
against O
street O
gangs O
and O
has O
found O
that O
such O
gang O
membership O
and O
its O
concurrent O
terrorism O
can O
be O
provocation O
for O
injuries O
and O
death O
suffered O
by O
gang O
members O
in O
gang O
wars. O
Such O
is O
not O
the O
case O
here O
. O
For O
the O
foregoing O
reasons O
, O
it O
is O
the O
order O
of O
this O
Court O
that O
Victor O
E. O
Ramirez O
was O
the O
innocent O
victim O
of O
a O
violent O
crime O
and O
Claimant O
, O
Delia O
Leyva O
, O
is O
entitled O
to O
compensation O
under O
the O
Act. O
We O
find O
that O
Claimant O
has O
substantiated O
her O
claim O
for O
$2 O
, O
594 O
for O
funeral O
expenses O
but O
has O
failed O
to O
prove O
by O
a O
preponderance O
of O
the O
evidence O
a O
loss O
of O
support. O
Claimants O
loss O
of O
support O
claim O
must O
be O
denied O

It O
is O
therefore O
ordered O

Claimant O
, O

, O
is O
awarded O
$2 O
, O
594 O
in O
full O
and O
final O
satisfaction O

On O

, O
the O

\u201ckilled O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty\u201d O
as O
defined O
by O
the O

The O
report O
indicated O
that O
Claimant O
had O
met O
the O
other O
conditions O
precedent O
for O
an O
award O
under O
the O
Act O
. O
The O
facts O
are O
as O
follows: O
On O
July O
29 O
, O
1992 O
, O
at O
approximately O
6:00 O
a.m. O

Deputy O
Chief O
Robert O
Medlicott O
was O
discovered O
dead O
in O
his O
bunk O
at O
the O
Berwyn O
fire O
house. O
The O
cause O
of O
death O
was O
determined O
to O
be O
cardiopulmonary O
arrest O
secondary O
to O
dilated O
cardiomyopathy O
. O
Former O
Fire O
Chief O
Ron O
Ballard O
testified O
that O
he O
was O
the O
fire O
chief O
at O
the O
time O
of O
Deputy O
Chief O
Medlicott O
s O
death. O
Chief O
Ballard O
testified O
that O
the O
normal O
number O
of O
work O
days O
per O
month O
for O
a O
firefighter O
was O
seven O
to O
eight O
days O
or O
168 O
to O
192 O
hours O
, O
depending O
on O
a O
number O
of O
factors O
, O
including O
the O
number O
of O
days O
in O
the O
month O
and O
the O
days O
on O
which O
the O
shift O
falls O
. O
Due O
to O
a O
number O
of O
injured O
officers O
, O
Deputy O
Chief O
Medlicott O
was O
required O
to O
work O
overtime. O
In O
June O
, O
1992 O
, O
the O
decedent O
worked O
290 O
hours O
and O
in O
July O
, O
1992 O
, O
up O
to O
the O
date O
of O
his O
death O
on O
the O
29th O
, O
he O
had O
worked O
264 O
hours O
. O
Chief O
Ballard O
testified O
that O
firemen O
, O
while O
on O
duty O
, O
are O
subject O
to O
the O
stress O
of O
answering O
an O
alarm O
and O
the O
stress O
of O
being O
cooped O
up O
in O
the O
firehouse O
for O
extended O
periods O
of O
time. O
The O
Claimant O
, O
Mrs. O
Medlicott O
, O
testified O
that O
Mr. O
Medlicott O
had O
to O
cancel O
plans O
to O
go O
to O
Boy O
Scout O
camp O
with O
his O
son O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
of O
July O
, O
1992 O
, O
due O
to O
the O
overtime O
he O
was O
required O
to O
work O
. O
According O
to O
the O
time O
records O
in O
evidence O
, O
Deputy O
Chief O
Robert O
Medlicott O
started O
his O
last O
shift O
on O
the O
27th O
*407day O
of O
July O
, O
on O
overtime. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
July O
28th O
, O
was O
his O
regular O
shift. O
Chief O
Ballard O
testified O
a O
regular O
shift O
is O
24 O
hours O
, O
so O
Deputy O
Chief O
Robert O
Medlicott O
was O
working O
back-to-back O
24-hour O
shifts. O
Mrs. O
Medlicott O
said O
that O
when O
he O
left O
for O
work O
on O
the O
27th O
, O
Deputy O
Chief O
Robert O
Medlicott O
seemed O
fine O
. O
The O
incident O
reports O
in O
evidence O
show O
that O
at O
6:45 O
p.m. O
on O
July O
28 O
, O
1995 O
, O
the O
second O
day O
of O
his O
double O
shift O
, O
the O
decedent O
answered O
a O
fire O
call. O
There O
was O
nothing O
particularly O
dramatic O
about O
the O
call O
but O
Chief O
Ballard O
testified O
, O
when O
the O
alarm O
sounds O
, O
the O
men O
don\u2019t O
know O
whether O
they O
will O
be O
involved O
in O
a O
dramatic O
fire O
or O
not. O
As O
an O
officer O
, O
the O
decedent O
would O
not O
have O
personally O
fought O
the O
fire O
but O
would O
have O
directed O
others O
. O
The O
detail O
headed O
by O
Deputy O
Chief O
Medlicott O
was O
back O
in O
service O
by O
7:30 O
that O
evening O
and O
there O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
be O
anyone O
who O
could O
say O
what O
time O
he O
laid O
down O
in O
his O
bunk O
for O
the O
night. O
Chief O
Ballard O
did O
say O
, O
however O
, O
that O
Deputy O
Chief O
Robert O
Medlicott O
was O
on O
duty O
, O
subject O
to O
an O
alarm O
at O
any O
time O
, O
until O
he O
was O
discovered O
at O
6:00 O
a.m. O
on O
July O
29 O
, O
1992 O
. O
The O
medical O
records O
of O
Robert O
Medlicott O
were O
examined O
by O
William O
Brice O
Buckingham O
, O
M.D. O
who O
testified O
as O
an O
expert. O
The O
records O
showed O
that O
Robert O
Medlicott O
had O
been O
treated O
for O
about O
one O
year O
prior O
to O
his O
death. O
In O
August O
of O
1991 O
, O
a O
cardioversion O
was O
performed O
by O
a O
Dr. O
Pacold. O
At O
that O
time O
, O
Robert O
Medlicott O
had O
a O
rapid O
pulse O
which O
had O
failed O
to O
respond O
to O
beta O
blockers O
or O
Digoxin. O
The O
cardioversion O
successfully O
re-regulated O
his O
heart O
rate. O
The O
doctor O
advised O
Mr. O
Medlicott O
to O
abstain O
from O
beer. O
Mr. O
Medlicott O
was O
an O
ex-smoker O
, O
having O
given O
up O
cigarettes O
ten O
years O
before O
, O
and O
he O
had O
been O
treated O
for O
the O
rapid O
pulse O
about O
ten O
years O
prior O
to O
his O
death O
. O
*408Mrs. O
Medlicott O
testified O
that O
the O
decedent O
was O
following O
the O
doctors O
orders O
with O
respect O
to O
taking O
his O
medications O
and O
abstaining O
from O
alcohol. O
She O
further O
testified O
that O
the O
decedent O
was O
not O
under O
any O
work O
restrictions O
from O
the O
doctor O
. O
Dr. O
Buckinghams O
report O
stated O
, O
\u201cThe O
work O
hours O
***** O
could O
be O
an O
aggravating O
or O
precipitating O
factor O
causing O
this O
patients O
death O
* O
* O
* O
working O
the O
number O
of O
hours O
described O
* O
* O
* O
could O
interfere O
sufficiently O
enough O
with O
his O
cardiac O
mechanism O
and O
add O
sufficient O
burden O
to O
his O
cardiac O
function O
to O
precipitate O
such O
an O
event.\u201d O
Dr. O
Buckingham O
further O
testified O
that O
Robert O
Medlicott O
had O
a O
serious O
disease O
and O
was O
at O
risk O
\u201cvirtually O
any O
time.\u201d O
It O
is O
important O
that O
Dr. O
Buckingham O
did O
not O
testify O
that O
the O
overtime O
work O
caused O
the O
death O
to O
a O
reasonable O
degree O
of O
medical O
certainty O
. O
The O
Act O
provides O
for O
compensation O
to O
the O
designated O
beneficiary O
where O
the O
fireman O
is O
\u201ckilled O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty.\u201d O
The O
Act O
defines O
\u201ctilled O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty\u201d O
as O
\u201closing O
one\u2019s O
life O
as O
a O
result O
of O
injury O
received O
in O
the O
active O
performance O
of O
duties O
as O
a O
* O
* O
* O
fireman O
* O
* O
* O
if O
the O
death O
occurs O
within O
one O
year O
from O
the O
date O
the O
injury O
was O
received O
and O
if O
that O
injury O
arose O
from O
violence O
or O
other O
accidental O
cause.\u201d O
The O
sole O
issue O
before O
this O
Court O
is O
whether O
the O
decedent O
was O
tilled O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty. O
In O
addressing O
this O
issue O
, O
the O
Court O
has O
previously O
stated: O
\u201cCases O
involving O
heart O
attacks O
are O
among O
the O
most O
difficult O
presented O
to O
this O
Court. O
The O
Court O
recognizes O
that O
police O
work O
involves O
stress O
and O
strain O
which O
can O
lead O
to O
heart O
attacks. O
In O
deciding O
whether O
an O
award O
should O
be O
granted O
, O
an O
effort O
is O
made O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
activities O
the O
decedent O
was O
performing O
precipitated O
the O
heart O
attack. O
In O
cases O
where O
a O
decedent O
is O
performing O
strenuous O
physical O
activities O
at O
the O
time O
the O
attack O
is O
suffered O
, O
the O
court O
has O
consistently O
granted O
awards. O
However O
, O
in O
cases O
where O
tire O
decedent O
was O
not O
performing O
strenuous O
physical O
activities O
when O
the O
heart O
attack O
was O
suffered O
, O
the O
Court O
must O
closely O
examine O
whether O
the O
circumstances O
surrounding O
the O
*409decedent\u2019s O
performance O
of O
duties O
prior O
to O
the O
time O
the O
fatal O
heart O
attack O
was O
suffered O
may O
have O
precipitated O
tire O
attack.\u201d O
In O
re O
Application O
of O
Smith O
(1990) O
, O
43 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
183 O
. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
Deputy O
Chief O
Medlicott O
had O
worked O
a O
substantial O
amount O
of O
overtime O
in O
the O
two O
months O
preceding O
his O
death O
and O
he O
did O
respond O
to O
a O
fire O
call O
on O
July O
28 O
, O
1992 O
, O
but O
the O
record O
indicated O
that O
it O
was O
not O
a O
serious O
incident. O
Claimant O
urges O
this O
Court O
to O
conclude O
that O
the O
cumulative O
effect O
of O
working O
overtime O
and O
the O
daily O
stress O
of O
waiting O
for O
the O
fire O
alarm O
were O
the O
cause O
of O
the O
decedent\u2019s O
heart O
attack O
. O
Claimant O
strongly O
relies O
on O
the O
Court\u2019s O
opinion O
in O
In O
re O
Application O
of O
Feehan O
(1980) O
, O
34 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
293. O
The O
facts O
in O
Feehan O
, O
however O
, O
are O
clearly O
distinguishable. O
Terry O
Wayne O
Feehan O
was O
a O
sheriffs O
investigator. O
He O
was O
found O
unconscious O
on O
a O
third O
floor O
bathroom O
of O
a O
county O
courthouse. O
The O
circumstances O
leading O
to O
Investigator O
Feehan\u2019s O
death O
were O
that O
he O
put O
in O
an O
extraordinary O
amount O
of O
overtime O
in O
the O
active O
performance O
of O
stressful O
police O
duties O
prior O
to O
his O
death. O
The O
work O
he O
performed O
consisted O
of O
investigating O
crimes O
committed O
and O
about O
to O
be O
committed O
, O
making O
arrests O
, O
performing O
searches O
, O
and O
conducting O
surveillance O
and O
stakeouts O
in O
connection O
with O
a O
burglary O
and O
drug O
dealing. O
On O
the O
date O
of O
his O
death O
, O
he O
traveled O
to O
deliver O
evidence O
to O
a O
crime O
lab. O
Upon O
his O
return O
, O
he O
was O
called O
to O
testify O
at O
a O
hearing O
in O
a O
burglary O
case. O
Investigator O
Feehan O
was O
unaware O
he O
would O
have O
to O
testify. O
He O
began O
his O
testimony O
at O
11:35 O
a.m. O
and O
testified O
for O
approximately O
30 O
minutes. O
He O
left O
the O
courtroom O
and O
was O
found O
dead O
in O
the O
restroom O
shortly O
thereafter. O
Investigator O
Feehan O
was O
in O
the O
active O
performance O
of O
stressful O
duties O
just O
prior O
to O
his O
death O
. O
Clearly O
, O
obligation O
and O
rigors O
faced O
daily O
by O
our O
firefighters O
result O
in O
stress O
for O
them. O
However O
, O
the O
evidence O
*410in O
the O
instant O
case O
is O
too O
remote O
to O
establish O
a O
causal O
connection O
between O
the O
employment O
and O
the O
death. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
death O
, O
Claimant O
was O
not O
involved O
in O
any O
strenuous O
activity. O
He O
was O
not O
responding O
to O
a O
call O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
he O
had O
long O
returned O
from O
the O
last O
call. O
The O
decedent O
apparently O
went O
to O
sleep O
and O
then O
died O
. O
The O
overtime O
and O
the O
daily O
stress O
of O
his O
duties O
as O
a O
fireman O
are O
too O
remote O
to O
establish O
a O
causal O
connection O
between O
his O
duties O
and O
his O
death. O
There O
is O
simply O
not O
enough O
evidence O
to O
establish O
that O
the O
circumstances O
surrounding O
decedents O
performance O
of O
duties O
prior O
to O
the O
time O
the O
fatal O
heart O
attack O
was O
suffered O
precipitated O
the O
heart O
attack O
. O
The O
Court O
must O
acknowledge O
the O
decedents O
contributions O
to O
the O
public O
during O
his O
career O
and O
the O
tragedy O
of O
his O
untimely O
death; O
however O
, O
there O
is O
not O
enough O
evidence O
to O
establish O
that O
Deputy O
Chief O
Medlicott O
was O
\u201ckilled O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty.\u201d O
We O
are O
not O
unsympathetic O
to O
the O
loss O
of O
Claimant. O
However O
, O
as O
a O
Court O
, O
we O
must O
follow O
the O
law. O
We O
have O
stretched O
the O
statutory O
definition O
of O
killed O
in O
the O
line O
of O
duty O
to O
its O
extreme O
in O
many O
cases O
but O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case O
are O
well O
beyond O
that O
limit O
. O
Deputy O
Chief O
Medlicott O
was O
a O
fine O
fireman O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
killed O
by O
violence O
or O
other O
accidental O
cause. O
He O
had O
a O
serious O
disease O
and O
died O
of O
that O
disease O
. O
For O
the O
foregoing O
reasons O
, O
it O
is O
the O
order O
of O
the O
Court O
that O

, O
denying O
the O
claim O
based O
on O
the O
investigatory O
report O
of O

The O
reason O

that O

made O
a O

request O
for O
a O

pursuant O
to O

of O
the O

A O
hearing O
was O
held O
before O
Commissioner O

on O
December O

, O
1994. O
The O
evidence O
consists O
of O
the O
Claimant O

testimony O
, O
bills O
submitted O
by O
the O
Claimant O
documenting O
expenses O
incurred O
for O
medical O
treatment O
, O
and O
employers\u2019 O
reports O

The O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
was O
walking O

the O
home O
of O
his O
girlfriend O
at O
6706 O
Forest O
Boulevard O
, O

where O
he O

that O
he O
did O
not O

The O
Claimant O
stated O
that O
the O
officers O
searched O
his O
home O
looking O
for O
the O
pistol O
with O
which O
he O
was O
shot O
. O
The O
Claimant\u2019s O

he O
went O
to O

, O
an O

harassed O
him O
and O
would O
not O
accept O
his O
answer O
that O
he O
did O
not O
see O
his O
assailant. O
To O
appease O
the O
officer O
, O
Claimant O
then O
told O
the O
officer O
that O
while O
he O
was O
standing O
at O
a O

, O
two O
white O
men O

and O
this O
was O
only O

the O
two O
months O
prior O

of O
the O

The O
other O
two O
reports O
recorded O

following O
the O
date O
of O
the O

Based O
on O
the O
report O

The O
Claimants O
physician O
allowed O
him O
to O
return O
to O
work O
on O
September O

Thus O
, O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
work O
for O
about O
one O

Section O
6.1(c) O
of O

different O

Because O

(705 O

505/8(c).) O
Claimant O
alleges O
that O
he O
was O
injured O
as O
a O
result O
of O
negligence O
in O
the O
maintenance O
and O
control O
of O
a O

so O
that O
they O
may O
not O

As O
a O

Claimant O
states O
that O
he O
was O
struck O
in O
the O
head O
with O
a O
fire O

by O
a O
fellow O
inmate O
and O
suffered O

promulgated O
by O
the O
Illinois O
Department O
of O
Corrections O
that O
fire O
extinguishers O

be O
locked O
in O
boxes. O
He O
states O
that O
it O
is O
common O
practice O
to O
keep O
fire O
extinguishers O
unlocked O
so O
that O
inmates O
can O
extinguish O
small O
fires O
more O
quickly O
than O
if O
a O

officer O
had O
to O

also O
stated O

no O

also O
called O
James O
Alemond O
, O
internal O
affairs O
investigator O
of O
the O

Alemond O
testified O
that O

was O
found O
to O
have O
been O

to O
damages O
of O
$45 O

The O

In O
order O
to O

the O

claim O
against O

, O
Claimant O
must O
show O
that O
Respondent O
had O
a O
duty O
, O
that O
the O

that O
the O

at O

the O

. O
*452Respondent O
has O
decided O
that O

Mr. O
Toth O
was O
an O
inmate O
at O
the O
Menard O

Center. O
On O
June O
17 O
, O
1980 O
, O
he O
was O
assigned O
to O
wash O
windows O
at O
the O
south O
cellblock. O
Mr. O
Toth O
was O
issued O
a O
safety O
belt O
. O
Mr. O
Toth O
was O
the O
only O
witness O
who O
testified O
in O
person. O
His O
testimony O
established O
, O
without O
contradiction O
, O
that O
the O
safety O
belt O
issued O
to O
him O
broke O
, O
causing O
him O
to O
fall O
30 O
to O
40 O
feet. O
He O
indicated O
that O
the O
belt O
was O
hanging O
in O
two O
pieces O
still O
attached O
to O
the O
bars O
after O
he O
fell. O
The O
Claimant O
did O
not O
pay O
for O
any O
of O
his O
medical O
expenses. O
He O
is O
seeking O
compensation O
for O
pain O
and O
suffering. O
He O
wore O
a O
back O
brace O
for O
over O
a O
year O
after O
the O
incident O
and O
a O
body O
cast O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
after O
the O
incident O
. O
Mr. O
Toth O
testified O
that O
the O
safety O
belt O
was O
worn O
and O
cracked. O
After O
he O
began O
using O
the O
safety O
belt O
to O
wash O
the O
windows O
, O
it O
broke O
and O
he O
fell. O
At O
the O
hearing O
of O
this O
case O

no O

Commissioner O
of O
this O
Court O
at O
4:00 O
p.m. O
on O
the O
day O

indicated O
that O

did O
not O
have O
sufficient O
time O
to O
prepare O

hearing. O
The O
Commissioner O
never O
received O
a O

The O
motion O

continue O
was O
denied O
, O
and O
the O
assistant O

was O
informed O
that O
the O
hearing O
would O
proceed. O
It O
should O
be O
noted O
for O
the O
record O
that O
this O
hearing O
was O
scheduled O
for O
April O
1 O
, O
1994 O
, O
involving O
an O
incident O
which O
occurred O

, O
and O
a O
claim O
which O
was O
filed O
on O
March O
3 O
, O
1981 O
. O
. O
The O
evidence O
established O
that O
Mr. O
Toth O
received O
a O
fracture O
of O
the O
third O
lumbar O
vertebra O
, O
the O
lateral O
cortex O
of O
the O
tarsal O
bone O
on O
his O

and O
the O
first O
metatarsal O
on O
his O
right O
foot O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
fall. O
He O
was O
treated O
at O

Hospital O
in O
Chester O
and O
was O
released O
on O
June O
23 O
, O

to O
provide O
them O

grounds: O
(1) O
failure O
to O
exhaust O
remedies O
(as O
required O
by O
section O
25 O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
Act O
(705 O
ILCS O
505/25) O
, O
and O
our O

(2) O
failure O
to O
state O
a O
cause O
of O
action; O
and O
(3) O
lack O
of O
subject O
matter O
jurisdiction O
over O
this O
claim O
. O
The O
allegations O
of O
the O
complaint O
are O
egregious. O
Claimant O
alleges O
that O
his O
tax O
refunds O
were O
withheld O
for O
six O
years O
and O
remitted O
to O
the O
Respondents O
Department O
of O
Public O
Aid O
(\u201cIDPA\u201d) O
based O
solely O
upon O
a O
false O
\u201caffidavit O
of O
service O
of O
order O
for O
withholding\u201d O
and O
a O
false O
\u201cnotice O
of O
delinquency\u201d O
that O
were O
filed O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
by O
IDPA O
personnel O
in O
a O
mistaken O
effort O
to O
collect O
child O
support O
from O
him O
when O
he O
was O
not O
liable O
for O
any O
child O
support O
obligations. O
Claimant O
alleges O
that O
these O
documents O
were O
false O
both O
in O
asserting O
the O
Claimants O
obligation O
and O
in O
asserting O
that O
an O
underlying O
adjudication O
against O
him O
had O
been O
made O
, O
when O
in O
fact O
there O
was O
not O
even O
a O
case O
pending O
*371against O
the O
Claimant. O
Claimant O
alleges O
, O
in O
effect O
, O
that O
the O
IDPA O
filed O
multiple O
false O
pleadings O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
in O
a O
nonexistent O
proceeding O
. O
After O
filing O
his O
claim O
in O
this O
Court O
, O
which O
originally O
sought O
return O
of O
the O
wrongfully O
withheld O
money O
as O
well O
as O
attorneys O
fees O
, O
Claimant O
successfully O
recovered O
his O
tax O
refunds O
from O
the O
Respondent. O
Claimant O
now O
seeks O
recovery O
here O
under O
Rule O
137 O
for O
$17 O
, O
880 O
of O
attorney\u2019s O
fees O
allegedly O
incurred O
in O
obtaining O
the O
order O
for O
the O
return O
of O
his O
tax O
refunds O
, O
as O
well O
as O
his O
costs O
and O
punitive O
damages O
. O
As O
offensive O
as O
the O
allegations O
in O
this O
case O
are O
, O
this O
Court O
is O
constrained O
to O
agree O
with O
the O
Respondent\u2019s O
third O
point O
\u2014 O
which O
ought O
to O
be O
the O
first O
point O
raised O
\u2014 O
that O
this O
court O
lacks O
jurisdiction O
over O
this O
Rule O
137 O
claim O
over O
an O
allegedly O
false O
pleading O
in O
another O
proceeding O
in O
another O
court O
, O
as O
we O
have O
previously O
held. O

In O
addition O
to O
Oder O
, O
which O
was O
based O
on O
that O
Claimant\u2019s O
inability O
to O
locate O
a O
statutory O
jurisdictional O
basis O
, O
there O
are O
several O
reasons O
for O
our O
conclusion O
. O
First O
, O
as O
Respondent O
correctly O
points O
out O
, O
the O
general O
jurisdictional O
grant O
in O
our O
Act O
expressly O
excludes O
\u201cclaims O
for O
expenses O
in O
civil O
litigation\u201d O
(section O
8(a) O
, O
Court O
of O
Claims O
Act; O
705 O
ILCS O
505/8(a)). O
We O
recognize O
that O
the O
statutory O
language O
of O
section O
8(a) O
is O
facially O
ambiguous: O
the O
\u201ccivil O
litigation\u201d O
phrase O
is O
susceptible O
of O
being O
read O
both O
within O
the O
jurisdictional O
grant O
as O
well O
as O
within O
the O
exception. O
However O
, O
the O
ultimate O
conclusion O
, O
informed O
by O
legislative O
draftsmanship O
, O
English O
grammar O
, O
the O
canons O
of O
statutory O
construction O
and O
, O
ultimately O
, O
by O
the O
apparent O
intent O
of O
the O
80th O
General O
Assembly O
that O
added O
this O
phrase O
to O
section O
8(a) O
, O
is O
necessarily O
that O
claims O
for O
civil O
litigation O
are O
not O
within O
our O
section O
8(a) O
jurisdiction O
. O
*372The O
language O
of O
section O
8(a) O
of O
our O
statute O
, O
in O
context O
, O
is O
as O
follows: O
\u201c\u00a78. O
Court O
of O
Claims O
jurisdiction. O
The O
court O
shall O
have O
exclusive O
jurisdiction O
to O
hear O
and O
determine O
the O
following O
matters: O
(a) O
All O
claims O
against O
the O
State O
founded O
upon O
any O
law O
of O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
, O
or O
upon O
any O
regulation O
thereunder O
by O
an O
executive O
or O
administrative O
officer O
or O
agency O
, O
other O
than O
claims O
arising O
under O
the O
Workers\u2019 O
Compensation O
Act O
or O
the O
Workers\u2019 O
Occupational O
Diseases O
Act O
, O
or O
claims O
for O
expenses O
in O
civil O
litigation.\u201d O
The O
ambiguity O
, O
of O
course O
, O
lies O
in O
the O
placement O
of O
the O
disjunctive O
phrase O
\u201cor O
claims O
for O
expenses O
in O
civil O
litigation\u201d O
at O
the O
very O
end O
of O
the O
sentence O
, O
where O
it O
may O
be O
read O
as O
part O
of O
the O
antecedent O
exclusion O
that O
commences O
with O
\u201cother O
than O
* O
\u201d O
* O
, O
\u201d O
or O
where O
it O
may O
be O
read O
as O
a O
continuation O
of O
the O
beginning O
litany O
of O
claims O
over O
which O
jurisdiction O
is O
being O
granted O
. O
The O
grammatical O
structure O
of O
the O
phrase O
suggests O
that O
it O
is O
part O
of O
the O
exclusion. O
The O
subject O
of O
the O
phrase O
is O
\u201cclaims O
for O
expenses\u201d O
or O
, O
more O
narrowly O
, O
\u201cclaims.\u201d O
This O
is O
parallel O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
exception O
clause O
, O
which O
excludes O
various O
\u201cclaims.\u201d O
This O
is O
not O
parallel O
to O
the O
construction O
of O
the O
jurisdictional O
grant O
, O
which O
does O
not O
repeat O
the O
term O
\u201cclaims\u201d O
but O
instead O
contains O
a O
short O
litany O
of O
legal O
foundations O
for O
claims. O
Thus O
the O
draftsmanship O
tends O
to O
support O
reading O
the O
civil O
litigation O
expense O
provision O
as O
an O
exception O
to O
our O
jurisdiction O
. O
Another O
aspect O
of O
the O
draftsmanship O
of O
section O
8(a) O
, O
the O
location O
of O
the O
phrase O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
sentence O
, O
is O
also O
persuasive. O
The O
placement O
of O
this O
phrase O
after O
the O
\u201cother O
than\u201d O
exclusion O
language O
invites O
an O
exclusionary O
interpretation; O
this O
placement O
makes O
sense O
only O
if O
the O
drafters O
intention O
were O
to O
add O
it O
to O
the O
exclusion. O
If O
the O
intention O
had O
been O
to O
add O
this O
phrase O
to O
the O
jurisdictional O
granting O
clause O
, O
there O
is O
no O
apparent O
reason O
not O
to O
have O
placed O
the O
phrase O
before O
the O
exclusion O
and O
thus O
clearly O
within O
the O
granting O
language O
. O
*373More O
convincing O
, O
however O
, O
is O
the O
analysis O
of O
the O
specific O
legislation O
that O
added O
this O
phrase O
to O
section O
8(a) O
in O
1977. O
The O
80th O
General O
Assembly O
enacted O
House O
Bill O
1502 O
over O
the O
veto O
of O
the O
governor O
in O
November O
, O
1977 O
, O
which O
thereby O
became O
Public O
Act O
80-1097. O
This O
amendatory O
act O
made O
two O
distinct O
changes O
in O
the O
law O
. O
Public O
Act O
80-1097 O
amended O
section O
41 O
of O
the O
[former] O
Civil O
Practice O
Act O
to O
authorize O
, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
, O
fee O
awards O
against O
the O
State O
and O
State O
agencies O
for O
false O
pleadings O
and O
, O
in O
connection O
with O
that O
change O
, O
added O
the O
\u201cor O
claims O
for O
expenses O
in O
civil O
litigation\u201d O
phrase O
to O
section O
8(a) O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
Act. O
These O
related O
changes O
were O
added O
to O
H.B. O
1502 O
by O
Senate O
Amendment O
number O
1 O
, O
in O
which O
the O
House O
of O
Representatives O
later O
concurred. O
(Not O
relevant O
here O
, O
PA. O
80-1097 O
also O
amended O
section O
9 O
and O
section O
22 O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
Act O
to O
make O
time O
limits O
and O
rules O
in O
this O
Court O
jurisdictional; O
that O
was O
the O
original O
purpose O
of O
H.B. O
1502 O
as O
introduced O
in O
the O
House.) O
Initially O
, O
it O
is O
clear O
that O
the O
insertion O
of O
the O
\u201ccivil O
litigation O
expenses\u201d O
phrase O
into O
section O
8(a) O
by O
the O
Senate O
amendment O
was O
an O
integral O
part O
of O
its O
purpose O
in O
extending O
the O
former O
section O
41 O
fee O
sanction O
remedy O
to O
the O
State. O
In O
this O
context O
, O
it O
would O
have O
made O
no O
sense O
and O
served O
no O
purpose O
for O
the O
legislature O
to O
have O
amended O
section O
8(a) O
in O
order O
to O
grant O
jurisdiction O
to O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
over O
the O
newly-authorized O
fee O
claims O
against O
the O
State. O
This O
follows O
because O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
any O
change O
to O
the O
section O
8(a) O
language; O
that O
section O
already O
would O
have O
provided O
just O
such O
jurisdiction O
, O
through O
the O
operation O
of O
its O
existing O
language O
\u201cclaims O
against O
the O
State O
founded O
upon O
any O
law O
of O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois.\u201d O
The O
amended O
section O
41 O
would O
become O
a O
substantive O
law O
authorizing O
a O
claim O
against O
the O
State O
, O
and O
the O
general O
clause O
of O
our O
section O
8(a) O
jurisdictional O
grant O
would O
have O
applied O
*374to O
it. O
Thus O
, O
the O
subject O
phrase O
\u2014 O
if O
read O
as O
a O
grant O
of O
jurisdiction O
\u2014 O
would O
be O
redundant O
and O
superfluous. O
We O
are O
instructed O
by O
the O
canons O
of O
statutory O
construction O
not O
to O
adopt O
a O
superfluous O
interpretation O
of O
statutory O
language O
, O
as O
the O
legislature O
is O
presumed O
to O
speak O
all O
statutory O
words O
with O
effect O
. O
This O
analysis O
militates O
strongly O
for O
a O
reading O
of O
the O
\u201ccivil O
htigation\u201d O
phrase O
as O
an O
exclusion O
from O
our O
jurisdiction O
\u2014 O
an O
exclusion O
made O
necessary O
by O
the O
pre-existing O
language O
of O
section O
8(a) O
, O
which O
otherwise O
would O
have O
given O
our O
Court O
exclusive O
jurisdiction O
over O
these O
section O
41 O
fee O
claims O
and O
would O
thus O
have O
precluded O
jurisdiction O
in O
the O
circuit O
court. O
The O
General O
Assembly O
made O
an O
election O
as O
between O
this O
Court O
and O
our O
courts O
of O
general O
jurisdiction O
for O
the O
disposition O
of O
section O
41 O
fee O
claims O
against O
the O
State O
and O
opted O
for O
the O
other O
courts. O
This O
conclusion O
is O
further O
supported O
by O
the O
language O
of O
section O
41 O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
its O
provisions O
are O
to O
apply O
to O
the O
State O
\u201cin O
the O
same O
manner\u201d O
as O
other O
parties O
(P.A. O

, O

, O
amending O

. O
This O
conclusion O
is O
confirmed O
by O
the O
Legislative O
Synopsis O
and O
Digest O
of O
1977 O
(spring O
and O
fall O
sessions) O
, O
a O
publication O
of O
the O
General O

(by O
its O

which O
is O
a O
non-authoritative O
guide O
to O
pending O

and O

The O

The O

reads O
, O
in O
material O
part O
, O
as O
follows: O
\u201c* O
* O
* O
Excludes O
from O
jurisdiction O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
, O
claims O
for O
expense O
in O
civil O
htigation. O
Amends O
the O
Civil O
Practice O
Act O
and O
provides O
that O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
or O
any O
agency O
thereof O
shall O
be O
subject O
to O
the O
provisions O
of O
this O
Section O
in O
this O
Section O
[sic] O
in O
the O
same O
manner O
as O
any O
other O
party. O
\u201c O
\u00b0 O
While O
not O
necessarily O
dispositive O
, O
this O
contemporaneous O
staff O
digest O
, O
which O
was O
before O
the O
enacting O
80th O
General O

unchanged O
throughout O
the O
legislative O
history O
of O

1502 O
following O
the O
adoption O
of O
the O
Senate O
amendment O
, O
including O
the O
veto-override O
vote O
, O
is O
compelling O
. O
Thus O
we O
conclude O
that O
\u201cclaims O
for O
expenses O
in O
civil O
litigation\u201d O
are O
outside O
of O
the O
section O
8(a) O
jurisdiction O
of O
this O
Court. O
This O
, O
of O
course O
, O
only O
excludes O
this O
subject O
matter O
from O
the O
section O
8(a) O
jurisdiction O
of O
this O
Court O
, O
and O
is O
potentially O
not O
the O
last O
word O
on O
the O
subject O
of O
our O
subject O
matter O
jurisdiction. O
A O
complete O
jurisdictional O
analysis O
requires O
consideration O
of O
the O
remaining O
provisions O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
Act O
, O
particularly O
section O
8 O
, O
and O
of O
other O
Illinois O
statutes O
which O
might O
provide O
a O
jurisdictional O
basis O
here O
. O
However O
, O
this O
secondary O
analysis O
is O
brief O
indeed. O
The O
remaining O
provisions O
of O
section O
8 O
of O
our O
Act O
plainly O
fail O
to O
grant O
jurisdiction O
to O
us O
to O
award O
attorneys O
fees O
for O
a O
false O
circuit O
court O
pleading O
under O
Rule O
137 O
or O
otherwise. O
Finally O
, O
neither O
Claimants O
nor O
our O
own O

have O
disclosed O
any O
arguable O
jurisdictional O
basis O
in O
any O
other O

dispositively O

as O
the O

fails O
to O

out O
\u2014 O

itself O
