# Sample dataset
We are restricted from making publicly available a significant set of data, so the file here consists of the last 10 lines of the Illinois state court opinions.

Each line is a JSON entry with metadata that follows the specification detailed here: https://case.law/docs/specs_and_reference/data_formats.  Of particular interest are the data in the "casebody.data" element, which is the XML text of the opinion.
