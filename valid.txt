precludes O
relief O

court O
in O
another O
action O
, O
which O
is O
precisely O
what O
the O
Claimant O
seeks O
by O
this O

In O
this O
case O
, O
the O
rule O
remits O
the O
Claimant O
to O
the O
circuit O
court O
for O
his O
remedy. O
This O
, O
finally O
, O
ends O
the O
analysis O
. O
*376We O
appreciate O
that O
the O
allegations O
before O
us O
state O
that O
there O
was O
no O
underlying O
circuit O
court O
proceeding O
, O
at O
least O
initially O
, O
in O
which O
the O
false O
pleading O
was O
filed O
, O
and O
thus O
there O
was O
arguably O
no O
legitimate O
\u201ccivil O
action\u201d O
in O
which O
the O
Claimant O
could O
have O
presented O
his O
attorneys O
fee O
petition O
within O
the O
strict O
language O
of O
Rule O
137. O
Nevertheless O
, O
that O
fact O
cannot O
and O
does O
not O
give O
this O
Court O
jurisdiction. O
Moreover O
, O
the O
Claimant O
also O
alleges O
that O
he O
was O
able O
to O
secure O
a O
court O
order O
for O
the O
return O
of O
his O
tax O
funds. O
It O
is O
unexplained O
why O
Claimant O
was O
unable O
, O
or O
failed O
, O
to O
bring O
his O
Rule O
137 O
claim O
in O
that O
proceeding O
, O
in O
the O
proper O
court O
, O
rather O
than O
here. O
What O
is O
clear O
is O
that O
as O
sympathetic O
as O
we O
may O
be O
with O
the O
Claimants O
story O
(assuming O
, O
of O
course O
, O
as O
we O
must O
at O
this O
stage O
, O
that O
his O
allegations O
are O
true) O
, O
this O
Court O
lacks O
the O
subject O
matter O
jurisdiction O
to O
entertain O
his O
Rule O
137 O
claim O
for O
fees O
. O
because O
we O
hold O
that O
we O
lack O
jurisdiction O
over O
this O

, O
it O
is O
unnecessary O

An O

a O
finding O
that O

that O

, O
Claimant O
Delgado O
, O
by O
and O
through O
her O
attorney O
, O
appealed O
the O

She O
asserted O
that O

would O
show O
that O
the O

son O
was O
dependent O
upon O
the O

She O
also O
disputes O

$3 O
, O

, O
contending O
that O

, O
at O
which O
time O
, O
Claimant O

Her O
attorney O
acknowledged O
that O
she O
was O
not O
eligible O

reimbursement O
of O

because O
she O
was O
not O

The O

review O
the O

This O
receipt O
is O
different O
than O
the O
receipts O
presented O
by O
Ms. O
Bueno O
at O
the O
hearing O
. O
Claimant O
Delgado O
testified O
that O
the O
deceased O
victim O
was O
the O
father O
of O
her O
son. O
She O
stated O
that O
neither O
she O
nor O
Claimant O
Bueno O
paid O
for O
the O
funeral. O
A O
collection O
was O
gathered O
from O
the O
victims O
friends O
, O
grandmother O
, O
and O
other O
family O
from O
his O
fathers O
side. O
She O
presented O
a O
receipt O
from O
Caribe O
of O
$3 O
, O
369 O
from O
Emely O
Delgado. O
She O
stated O
that O
the O
victims O
stepmother O
, O
Natalia O
Molina O
, O
was O
involved O
in O
collecting O
the O
money. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
argued O
with O
Natalia O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
collection O
of O
the O
money; O
and O
Natalia O
gave O
some O
of O
the O
collection O
to O
Claimant O
Bueno O
and O
some O
to O
Caribe. O
She O
stated O
that O
Claimant O
Bueno O
did O
not O
pay O
the O
funeral O
expense O
out O
of O
her O
own O
pocket O
but O
from O
a O
collection O
taken O
from O
the O
victims O
friends O
and O
family O
. O
*640Claimant O
Delgado O
testified O
her O
name O
was O
put O
on O
the O
receipt O
because O
she O
and O
Claimant O
Bueno O
entered O
into O
an O
oral O
agreement. O
She O
presented O
a O
signed O
funeral O
directors O
report O
, O
dated O
September O
11 O
, O
1992 O
, O
showing O
that O
Emely O
Delgado O
paid O
$3 O
, O
369 O
for O
funeral O
and O
burial O
expenses. O
Claimant O
Delgado O
believes O
that O
the O
victims O
grandmother O
paid O
$1 O
, O
000 O
, O
his O
aunts O
husband O
paid O
$580 O
, O
his O
aunt O
bought O
the O
suit O
, O
and O
the O
rest O
was O
contributed O
by O
his O
friends O
. O
In O
relation O
to O
the O
oral O
agreement O
between O
the O
Claimants O
, O
Claimant O
Delgado O
stated O
that O
the O
receipt O
would O
be O
put O
in O
her O
name O
and O
the O
$3 O
, O
000 O
reimbursement O
would O
be O
split O
three O
ways: O
$1 O
, O
000 O
for O
the O
victims O
son O
, O
$1 O
, O
000 O
for O
the O
monument O
, O
and O
$1 O
, O
000 O
for O
Claimant O
Bueno. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
\u201cwent O
behind O
my O
back O
, O
went O
to O
the O
funeral O
director O
, O
and O
asked O
her O
for O
a O
receipt.\u201d O
When O
she O
learned O
that O
Claimant O
Bueno O
was O
going O
to O
receive O
$3 O
, O
000 O
for O
funeral O
and O
burial O
expenses O
, O
she O
asked O
Claimant O
Bueno O
whether O
she O
was O
still O
going O
to O
give O
her O
$1 O
, O
000 O
for O
her O
son O
, O
and O
was O
told O
\u201cNo.\u201d O
That O
is O
why O
she O
got O
a O
lawyer O
and O
appealed O
the O
order O
. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
said O
that O
Claimant O
Delgado O
was O
lying. O
She O
stated O
that O
she O
used O
money O
from O
social O
security O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
monument. O
She O
receives O
disability O
payments O
from O
the O
Social O
Security O
Administration. O
She O
said O
that O
the O
money O
paid O
to O
Caribe O
came O
from O
her. O
She O
said O
her O
friend O
gave O
her O
$600. O
His O
name O
was O
\u201cSammy\u201d O
but O
she O
did O
not O
know O
his O
last O
name. O
She O
said O
\u201cNatie O
, O
\u201d O
her O
sons O
stepmother O
, O
collected O
$1 O
, O
500. O
She O
also O
collected O
approximately O
$500 O
from O
friends O
but O
forgets O
how O
much O
she O
collected. O
She O
claims O
to O
have O
paid O
$600 O
. O
Claimant O
Delgados O
counsel O
indicated O
she O
would O
stipulate O
that O
Ms. O
Bueno O
paid O
$600 O
of O
the O
burial O
and O
funeral O
expenses. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
then O
claimed O
she O
paid O
more O
than O
$600. O
She O
asked O
for O
a O
continuance O
to O
\u201cbring O
all O
the O
papers.\u201d O
*641On O
the O
issue O
of O
loss O
of O
support O
, O
Claimant O
Delgado O
testified O
that O
her O
son O
, O
Rafael O
Giovanni O
Padilla O
, O
Jr. O
, O
bom O
on O
December O
19 O
, O
1983 O
, O
was O
the O
son O
of O
the O
victim. O
She O
was O
unsuccessful O
in O
obtaining O
later O
tax O
returns O
, O
beyond O
the O
1989 O
return O
, O
of O
the O
victim. O
In O
1990 O
and O
1991 O
he O
was O
working O
at O
a O
temporary O
place O
, O
but O
was O
still O
supporting O
the O
boy. O
He O
gave O
her O
cash O
for O
the O
support O
every O
week O
, O
usually O
between O
$50 O
to O
$125 O
per O
week. O
One O
time O
it O
was O
$485. O
He O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
with O
his O
son O
. O
The O
employer O
report O
indicates O
that O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death O
the O
victim O
was O
employed O
by O
Coles O
Appliance O
and O
Furniture O
Company O
from O
March O
, O
1992 O
, O
to O
the O
date O
of O
his O
death. O
The O
victim O
received O
his O
first O
check O
on O
March O
21 O
, O
1992 O
. O
At O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
hearing O
, O
the O
record O
was O
left O
open O
for O
either O
Claimant O
to O
present O
any O
further O
documents. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
wanted O
to O
present O
a O
list O
of O
persons O
who O
gave O
her O
money O
but O
had O
left O
it O
at O
home. O
She O
was O
instructed O
to O
mail O
it O
together O
with O
a O
letter O
if O
she O
desired. O
Subsequent O
to O
the O
hearing O
, O
Claimant O
Bueno O
mailed O
a O
letter O
together O
with O
a O
letter O
from O
Jorge O
L. O
Crespo O
and O
a O
garbled O
listing O
of O
contributions. O
(English O
translations O
were O
provided O
by O
the O
Commissioners O

. O
This O
is O
a O
troublesome O
case. O
Claimant O
Delgado O
admits O
that O
she O
filed O
false O
information O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
funeral O
and O
burial O
expenses. O
She O
contends O
that O
it O
was O
done O
in O
furtherance O
of O
an O
agreement O
with O
Claimant O
Bueno. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
denies O
that O
this O
agreement O
took O
place. O
Claimant O
Buenos O
testimony O
is O
expressly O
inconsistent. O
At O
times O
she O
states O
that O
she O
paid O
all O
of O
the O
funeral O
and O
burial O
expenses O
, O
and O
at O
other O
times O
she O
states O
that O
she O
paid O
$600 O
of O
the O
funeral O
and O
burial O
expenses. O
The O
funeral O
home\u2019s O
records O
are O
also O
inconsistent. O
The O
funeral O
home O
either O
negligently O
reported O
receipt O
of O
the O
same O
funds O
, O
or O
has O
*642participated O
in O
the O
presentation O
of O
false O
information O
as O
alleged O
by O
Claimant O
Delgado O
. O
This O
Court O
finds O
that O
Claimant O
Buenos O
presentation O
of O
false O
information O
, O
i.e. O
, O
she O
paid O
all O
of O
the O
expenses O
, O
in O
light O
of O
her O
testimony O
that O
the O
bulk O
of O
the O
money O
came O
from O
a O
collection O
, O
is O
sufficiently O
inconsistent O
to O
bar O
her O
from O
any O
recovery. O
(740 O
ILCS O
45/20.) O
Public O
policy O
is O
best O
served O
by O
discouraging O
the O
presentation O
of O
false O
information O
. O
On O
the O
loss O
of O
support O
claim O
, O
the O
same O
public O
policy O
concerns O
expressed O
above O
apply O
to O
Claimant O
Delgados O
provision O
of O
false O
information O
on O
the O
funeral O
expenses. O
However O
, O
the O
support O
that O
would O
be O
provided O
would O
be O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
victims O
minor O
child O
, O
aged O
eight O
years O
and O
205 O
days O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
the O
victims O
death. O
The O
record O
does O
establish O
that O
the O
victim O
was O
employed O
for O
some O
time O
during O
the O
six-month O
period O
prior O
to O
his O
death. O
The O
total O
net O
earnings O
for O
the O
six-month O
period O
was O
$2 O
, O
379.86 O
, O
or O
an O
average O
monthly O
net O
income O
of O
$396.64. O
There O
is O
no O
documentation O
to O
show O
that O
he O
was O
actually O
providing O
support O
for O
his O
son. O
Claimant O
Delgado O
stated O
that O
neither O
she O
nor O
the O
victim O
maintained O
a O
checking O
account O
and O
the O
victim O
would O
give O
her O
cash O
ranging O
from O
$50 O
to O
$125 O
per O
week. O
No O
witnesses O
were O
presented O
to O
corroborate O
these O
payments. O
Her O
counsel O
indicated O
that O
the O
victim O
was O
providing O
an O
average O
of O
$250 O
per O
month. O
This O
amount O
is O
64 O
percent O
of O
his O
average O
monthly O
net O
income. O
Claimant O
Bueno O
did O
not O
dispute O
that O
the O
victim O
was O
making O
cash O
payments O
to O
support O
his O
son. O
She O
did O
state O
that O
the O
victim O
was O
living O
with O
her O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death; O
therefore O
, O
it O
may O
be O
reasonable O
to O
conclude O
that O
his O
own O
living O
expenses O
might O
not O
be O
as O
high O
if O
he O
were O
kving O
on O
his O
own O
. O
This O
Court O
finds O
that O
Claimant O
Delgado O
has O
not O
established O
that O
support O
was O
being O
provided. O
It O
is O
therefore O
*643ordered O
that O
this O
Courts O
order O
of O
November O

1993 O
, O
is O
amended O

1989 O
, O
Claimant O
, O
Dana O
van O
Der O
Heyden O
(\u201cClaimant\u201d) O
, O
his O
wife O
and O
several O
friends O
visited O
Starved O
Rock O
State O
Park O
(\u201cStarved O
Rock\u201d) O
near O
Ottawa O
, O
Illinois. O
After O
approximately O
an O
hour O
hiking O
on O
the O
trails O
, O
Claimant O
, O
his O
wife O
and O
one O
of O
his O
friends O
were O
trying O
to O
find O
their O
way O
back O
to O
their O
van O
in O
the O
parking O
lot O
near O
the O
Riverside O
entrance. O
When O
they O
spotted O
a O
vehicle O
entrance O
, O
they O
left O
the O
trail O
and O
cut O
across O
a O
wooded O
area O
to O
a O
grassy O
area O
near O
the O
vehicular O
entrance O
gate. O
At O
the O
side O
of O
the O
32-foot O
double O
gate O
, O
the O
park O
administration O
had O
constructed O
barricades O
designed O
to O
keep O
motorcycles O
, O
four-wheel O
drive O
and O
utility O
vehicles O
and O
other O
off-road O
vehicles O
from O
gaining O
access O
to O
the O
park O
during O
the O
times O
when O
the O
gates O
, O
and O
*342thus O
the O
park O
, O
are O
closed. O
The O
barricade O
, O
built O
in O
1977 O
, O
consists O
of O
55-gallon O
drums O
sunk O
approximately O
two-thirds O
of O
the O
way O
into O
the O
ground O
, O
allowing O
about O
12 O
inches O
of O
exposed O
barrel O
to O
remain O
above O
ground. O
The O
drums O
are O
filled O
with O
concrete O
and O
have O
a O
cable O
strung O
in O
continuous O
fashion O
from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O
steel O
gate O
to O
each O
drum O
at O
spaced O
intervals O
, O
with O
tire O
cable O
terminating O
by O
being O
wrapped O
around O
the O
trunk O
of O
a O
tree O
and O
tied. O
The O
cable O
runs O
approximately O
10 O
to O
12 O
inches O
off O
the O
ground. O
In O
negotiating O
his O
way O
back O
to O
the O
parking O
lot O
, O
Claimant O
has O
testified O
that O
he O
tripped O
over O
the O
cable O
, O
causing O
him O
to O
fall O
on O
his O
elbow O
, O
striking O
the O
concrete O
\u201clid\u201d O
in O
the O
middle O
drum O
of O
five O
situated O
on O
the O
east O
side O
of O
the O
entrance. O
Claimant O
sustained O
serious O
injury O
to O
his O
elbow O
, O
necessitating O
multiple O
surgeries O
and O
causing O
Claimant O
to O
lose O
several O
months O
of O
work. O
Claimant O
also O
alleges O
that O
his O
inability O
to O
\u201clock\u201d O
his O
elbow O
has O
curtailed O
his O
career O
as O
an O
HVAC O
(heating O
, O
ventilating O
and O
air O
conditioning) O
installer O
, O
permanently O
depressed O
his O
earning O
power O
, O
and O
caused O
him O
embarrassing O
disfigurement O
, O
pain O
and O
suffering O
, O
and O
permanent O
injury O
. O
The O
Court O
does O
not O
doubt O
that O
Claimant O
suffered O
an O
injury O
and O
that O
it O
might O
well O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
Claimant\u2019s O
striking O
a O
concrete-filled O
barrel O
at O
the O
park. O
The O
question O
is O
whether O
Claimant O
proved O
by O
a O
preponderance O
of O
the O
evidence O
that O
(a) O
a O
dangerous O
condition O
existed; O
(b) O
that O
the O
State O
knew O
of O
the O
condition; O
and O
, O
(c) O
that O
the O
condition O
caused O
the O
fall O
. O
Because O
the O
State O
erected O
the O
barricade O
in O
question O
, O
the O
State O
was O
obviously O
aware O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
barricade. O
The O
question O
becomes O
one O
of O
whether O
the O
barricade O
, O
as O
originally O
erected O
and O
as O
maintained O
, O
presented O
an O
unreasonably O
dangerous O
condition O
on O
July O
3 O
, O
1989. O
The O
question O
of O
liability O
ultimately O
is O
whether O
the O
State O
*343should O
have O
reasonably O
foreseen O
that O
pedestrians O
using O
the O
park O
would O
decide O
to O
cut O
across O
established O
trails O
, O
circumvent O
the O
gate O
and O
would O
not O
recognize O
that O
a O
cable O
had O
been O
strung O
between O
the O
barrels O
used O
as O
a O
barricade O
. O
Claimant O
relies O
on O
the O
testimony O
of O
his O
expert O
, O
Francis O
W. O
Biehl O
, O
an O
engineer. O
Mr. O
Biehl O
testified O
that O
he O
relied O
upon O
guides O
used O
in O
setting O
up O
snowmobiling O
and O
skiing O
trails O
as O
well O
as O
general O
forest O
management O
guides. O
It O
was O
Mr. O
Biehls O
opinion O
that O
the O
park O
could O
have O
utilized O
other O
methods O
and O
materials O
at O
the O
accident O
scene O
, O
giving O
as O
examples O
, O
four-foot O
upright O
timbers O
spaced O
apart O
, O
wooden O
posts O
with O
an O
upright O
steel O
cable O
hung O
between O
, O
and O
even O
using O
fallen O
trees O
or O
brush. O
However O
, O
the O
testimony O
of O
complex O
superintendent O
Jon O
Blume O
is O
compelling. O
Wooden O
gates O
and O
posts O
had O
been O
used O
prior O
to O
1977. O
Motorcycle O
gangs O
and O
other O
people O
intent O
on O
violating O
the O
parks O
curfew O
and O
substance O
abuse O
laws O
, O
or O
on O
committing O
acts O
of O
vandalism O
would O
drive O
over O
the O
wooden O
gates O
smashing O
them O
, O
use O
chain O
saws O
on O
other O
wooden O
barricades O
, O
use O
winches O
to O
tear O
down O
post-and-upright O
barricades O
, O
rip O
trees O
from O
the O
ground O
, O
and O
set O
fire O
to O
brush O
or O
logs O
used O
as O
barricades. O
Only O
the O
concrete-filled O
barrels O
and O
cable O
have O
effectively O
deterred O
lawbreakers. O
Given O
the O
potential O
for O
crime O
and O
mischief O
and O
the O
States O
duty O
to O
protect O
campers O
from O
criminal O
conduct O
and O
forest O
fires O
, O
the O
States O
solution O
is O
neither O
draconian O
nor O
unreasonable. O
Mr. O
Biehl O
suggested O
that O
the O
cable O
should O
have O
been O
placed O
at O
a O
higher O
level O
, O
possibly O
four O
feet O
or O
eye O
level; O
however O
, O
he O
had O
earlier O
stated O
that O
he O
testified O
in O
Michigan O
concerning O
a O
snowmobile O
decapitation. O
Mr. O
Biehl O
further O
admitted O
that O
during O
the O
considerable O
time O
he O
spent O
observing O
the O
barricade O
and O
the O
surrounding O
area O
, O
he O
saw O
no O
one O
attempt O
to O
walk O
over O
the O
barrier O
as O
Claimant O
had O
attempted O
. O
*344Finally O
, O
Blume O
and O
Vecchi O
, O
the O
site O
superintendent O
, O
testified O
that O
neither O
of O
them O
have O
any O
record O
or O
recollection O
of O
any O
report O
of O
injury O
or O
complaint O
regarding O
the O
barricaded O
area. O
Much O
was O
made O
by O
Claimant O
of O
the O
question O
of O
what O
color O
the O
cable O
was O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
injury. O
We O
accept O
the O
testimony O
of O
Claimants O
expert O
that O
it O
was O
a O
\u201cgrayish O
steel O
color.\u201d O
Whether O
the O
State O
should O
have O
painted O
the O
cable O
a O
bright O
yellow O
or O
orange O
is O
speculation O
, O
and O
does O
not O
indicate O
that O
a O
different O
color O
cable O
would O
have O
prevented O
this O
accident O
. O
Claimant O
hurt O
his O
credibility O
in O
at O
least O
two O
instances. O
First O
, O
Claimants O
attempts O
to O
prove O
lost O
wages O
were O
lamentable. O
Claimant O
admitted O
that O
he O
made O
about O
$19 O
, O
000 O
to O
$20 O
, O
000 O
in O
1988 O
, O
but O
reported O
only O
$12 O
, O
703 O
for O
1989 O
, O
the O
year O
in O
which O
the O
injury O
occurred. O
This O
$12 O
, O
703 O
, O
representing O
eight O
months O
wages O
, O
only O
extrapolates O
, O
at O
best O
, O
to O
about O
$19 O
, O
000 O
, O
but O
Claimant O
stated O
that O
$12 O
, O
703 O
was O
that O
high O
, O
because O
he O
had O
had O
a O
\u201cgood O
summer. O
I O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
money.\u201d O
Claimant O
further O
testified O
that O
during O
his O
rehabilitation O
, O
his O
father O
helped O
out O
with O
checks O
drawn O
on O
the O
company O
which O
employed O
Claimant O
, O
meaning O
the O
$12 O
, O
703 O
was O
further O
inflated O
from O
the O
amount O
Claimant O
actually O
would O
have O
earned O
in O
1989 O
and O
1990. O
The O
record O
indicates O
Claimant O
would O
have O
earned O
no O
more O
than O
$16 O
, O
000 O
to O
$20 O
, O
000 O
per O
year O
during O
the O
lost O
time O
, O
not O
$31 O
, O
000 O
to O
$32 O
, O
000 O
as O
Claimant O
testified. O
Further O
, O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
had O
been O
\u201cmade O
a O
manager\u201d O
in O
1980 O
, O
and O
ostensibly O
was O
not O
an O
installer O
, O
upon O
which O
he O
based O
his O
income O
testimony O
. O
Second O
, O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
the O
cable O
was O
dangerous O
because O
it O
was O
totally O
obscured O
by O
leaves. O
This O
would O
have O
required O
leaves O
piled O
up O
to O
almost O
ten O
inches O
in O
depth. O
The O
difficulty O
with O
this O
reasoning O
is: O
(1) O
Labor O
Day O
weekend O
marks O
the O
end O
of O
summer O
and O
is O
usually O
*345still O
extremely O
warm. O
The O
leaves O
would O
not O
have O
changed O
color O
by O
then O
, O
much O
less O
fall O
in O
the O
quantities O
needed O
to O
accumulate O
a O
layer O
ten O
inches O
deep; O
and O
, O
(2) O
Claimants O
own O
pictures O
, O
taken O
either O
\u201cshortly O
after O
the O
accident\u201d O
or O
\u201cwithin O
one O
week O
after O
the O
accident O
, O
\u201d O
which O
should O
, O
being O
deeper O
into O
the O
fall O
, O
show O
more O
fallen O
leaves O
, O
instead O
show O
insufficient O
leaves O
to O
cover O
the O
grass O
, O
much O
less O
canopy O
the O
cable O
in O
question O
. O
The O
barricade O
and O
cable O
system O
installed O
by O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
at O
Starved O
Rock O
near O
the O
main O
vehicular O
entrance O
and O
in O
four O
other O
areas O
of O
the O
park O
, O
was O
designed O
to O
ameliorate O
a O
serious O
problem O
of O
criminal O
trespass O
to O
park O
grounds O
after O
curfew. O
Its O
design O
and O
execution O
are O
reasonable O
under O
such O
circumstances. O
More O
importandy O
, O
the O
State O
had O
no O
notice O
that O
its O
barricades O
represented O
a O
dangerous O
condition O
to O
park O
users. O
The O
lack O
of O
incidents O
in O
the O
12 O
years O
after O
installation O
of O
the O
barricade O
but O
prior O
to O
the O
Claimants O
injury O
, O
and O
in O
the O
nearly O
five O
years O
after O
the O
injury O
but O
prior O
to O
the O
trial O
, O
indicates O
to O
the O
contrary O
. O
It O
is O
therefore O
ordered O
, O
adjudged O
and O
decreed O
that O
this O
claim O
be O
, O
and O
it O
is O
hereby O
, O
dismissed O
with O
prejudice O
and O
forever O
barred O

Frederick B-A

This O
cause O
comes O
before O
the O
Court O
on O
the O
application O
of O
Claimant O
, O
Ralph O
J. O
Hopkins O
, O
for O
benefits O
pursuant O
to O
the O
Illinois O
Crime O
Victims O
Compensation O
Act. O
The O
application O
was O
filed O
on O
January O
15 O
, O
1988. O
The O
history O
of O
the O
case O
indicates O
the O
Attorney O
General O
filed O
his O
investigatory O
report O
on O
November O
1 O
, O
1989 O
, O
and O
the O
Court O
entered O
an O
order O
denying O
the O
claim O
on O
January O
4 O
, O
1990. O
The O
basis O
for O
the O
denial O
was O
a O
finding O
by O
the O
Court O
that O
the O
Claimants O
conduct O
contributed O
to O
his O
injury O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
as O
to O
warrant O
that O
the O
Claimant O
be O
denied O
entitlement O
to O
compensation O
. O
On O
January O
22 O
, O
1990 O
, O
the O
Claimant O
requested O
a O
hearing O
before O
the O
Commissioner O
assigned O
to O
the O
case O
to O
contest O
the O
initial O
denial O
of O
the O
claim O
based O
on O
the O
Respondents O
investigatory O
report. O
The O
Commissioner O
tried O
the O
case O
on O
December O
14 O
, O
1990 O
, O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
liability O
only. O
The O
Court O
learned O
at O
the O
oral O
arguments O
that O
there O
was O
a O
tacit O
agreement O
between O
counsel O
to O
try O
the O
issue O
of O
liability O
bifurcated O
from O
the O
issue O
of O
damages. O
In O
the O
event O
the O
Claimant O
prevailed O
and O
damages O
could O
not O
be O
stipulated O
to O
, O
a O
second O
trial O
would O
be O
held O
to O
determine O
damages. O
While O
this O
procedure O
may O
not O
be O
the O
most O
economical O
in O
time O
for O
the O
parties O
and O
the O
Court O
, O
this O
procedure O
is O
not O
disapproved O
in O
crime O
victims O
cases. O
This O
procedure O
may O
be O
useful O
in O
many O
crime O
victims O
cases O
where O
damages O
are O
easily O
ascertainable O
and O
the O
Attorney O
General O
has O
the O
ability O
and O
staff O
to O
ascertain O
the O
statutory O
damages. O
However O
, O
it O
would O
help O
ensure O
judicial O
economy O
if O
the O
parties O
would O
advise O
the O
Commissioners O
of O
disputed O
damage O
issues O
in O
crime O
victims O
cases O
, O
where O
possible O
, O
so O
that O
all O
fact O
issues O
can O
be O
determined O
in O
one O
trial. O
By O
allowing O
this O
*588procedure O
of O
bifurcation O
in O
crime O
victims O
cases O
, O
we O
acknowledge O
that O
crime O
victims O
cases O
are O
different O
than O
most O
other O
cases O
and O
that O
this O
bifurcated O
procedure O
can O
be O
appropriate O
in O
crime O
victims O
cases O
. O
At O
the O
trial O
on O
liability O
before O
the O
Commissioner O
, O
the O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
one O
week O
prior O
to O
March O
5 O
, O
1987 O
, O
he O
gave O
a O
ride O
to O
an O
acquaintance O
named O
Janice O
who O
worked O
at O
a O
tavern O
located O
at O
511 O
S. O
St. O
Louis. O
Janice O
objected O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
Claimant O
was O
going O
to O
stop O
at O
a O
few O
places O
before O
taking O
her O
home. O
Janice O
decided O
to O
get O
out O
of O
Claimant\u2019s O
car O
and O
to O
find O
another O
means O
of O
getting O
home. O
On O
March O
5 O
, O
1987 O
, O
Claimant O
went O
to O
the O
tavern O
located O
at O
511 O
S. O
St. O
Louis. O
Janice O
was O
sitting O
by O
the O
door. O
Janice O
shoved O
Claimant O
in O
the O
face O
and O
the O
lights O
went O
out O
in O
the O
tavern. O
After O
the O
lights O
went O
out O
, O
Claimant O
was O
stabbed. O
Claimant O
denied O
that O
he O
started O
the O
fight O
which O
led O
to O
his O
injury O
. O
The O
Respondent O
called O
no O
witnesses. O
The O
Respondent O
sought O
to O
introduce O
the O
police O
reports O
which O
indicate O
that O
Claimant O
may O
have O
started O
the O
fight. O
The O
Claimant O
objected O
to O
the O
introduction O
of O
the O
police O
reports O
and O
the O
Commissioner O
sustained O
the O
objection O
pursuant O
to O
the O
authority O
of O
Tamm O
v. O
State O
(1982) O
, O
35 O
Ill. O
Ct. O
Cl. O
805. O
Without O
the O
police O
reports O
, O
the O
only O
evidence O
before O
the O
Court O
is O
the O
Claimant\u2019s O
testimony O
indicating O
he O
did O
not O
start O
the O
altercation. O
The O
Claimant O
argues O
that O
police O
reports O
are O
inadmissible O
hearsay. O
The O
Respondent O
argues O
that O
the O
Crime O
Victims O
Compensation O
Act O
allows O
the O
Commissioner O
and O
the O
Court O
to O
consider O
all O
evidence O
helpful O
to O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
Claimants O
right O
to O
benefits. O
(740 O
ILCS O
45/13.1(b).) O
Section O
13.1(b) O
states O
that O
at O
\u201chearings O
held O
under O
this O
Act O
before O
Commissioners O
of O
the O
Court O
of O
Claims O
, O
any O
statement O
, O
document O
, O
information O
or O
matter O
may O
be O
received O
in O
evidence O
if O
in O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
Court O
or O
its O
Commissioner O
such O
evidence O
*589would O
contribute O
to O
a O
determination O
of O
the O
claim O
, O
regardless O
of O
whether O
such O
evidence O
would O
be O
admissible O
in O
a O
court O
of O
law.\u201d O
(Emphasis O
added.) O
Normally O
police O
reports O
are O
not O
admissible O
in O
a O
court O
of O
law O
except O
for O
purposes O
of O
impeachment O
of O
the O
officers O
testimony. O
We O
have O
held O
as O
we O
did O
in O
Tamm O
, O
supra O
, O
that O
in O
cases O
other O
than O
crime O
victims O
cases O
police O
reports O
are O
normally O
inadmissible. O
However O
, O
the O
statute O
in O
crime O
victims O
cases O
specifically O
allows O
for O
the O
receipt O
of O
any O
document O
in O
evidence O
regardless O
of O
its O
admissibility O
in O
a O
court O
of O
law O
if O
either O
the O
Court O
or O
Commissioner O
is O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
such O
document O
would O
contribute O
to O
the O
resolution O
of O
the O
case O
. O
While O
in O
most O
cases O
, O
we O
would O
agree O
that O
police O
reports O
should O
not O
be O
admissible O
, O
we O
do O
find O
that O
there O
are O
crime O
victims O
cases O
where O
police O
reports O
may O
be O
helpful O
and O
should O
be O
admitted. O
Where O
witnesses O
are O
deceased O
, O
unavailable O
or O
refuse O
to O
testify O
, O
police O
reports O
may O
help O
the O
Court O
in O
resolving O
the O
issues. O
In O
such O
cases O
, O
the O
Court O
must O
consider O
the O
weight O
to O
be O
given O
to O
such O
reports O
in O
the O
face O
of O
testimony O
at O
the O
trial O
which O
is O
the O
subject O
of O
cross-examination. O
Generally O
more O
weight O
will O
be O
given O
to O
live O
witnesses O
who O
are O
subject O
to O
cross-examination O
or O
where O
the O
police O
reports O
are O
inconsistent. O

The O
trial O
transcript O
indicates O
that O
the O
Commissioner O
believed O
police O
reports O
were O
inadmissible O
under O
any O
circumstances. O
Because O
of O
this O
belief O
and O
because O
the O
trial O
only O
considered O
liability O
and O
not O
damages O
, O
we O
remand O
this O
case O

the O
Commissioner O

to O
the O
case O

a O

In O
the O

unable O
to O
present O
witnesses O

as O
a O
demonstra*412tor O
car O
instead O
of O
a O
pleasure O
car O
, O
and O
that O
such O
use O
increased O
the O
hazard O
of O

, O
and O
that O
the O
appellees O
failed O
to O
notify O
appellant O
of O
such O
increased' O
hazard. O
The O
seventh O
plea O
alleges O
that O
the O
automobile O
in O
question O
had O
not O
been O
kept O
in O
a O
garage O
as O
required O
by O
the-terms O
of O
the O
policy O
, O
and O
that O
the O
appellees O
knew O
this O
and O
that O
the O
failure O
to O
keep O
it O
in O
a O
garage O
increased O
the O
hazard O
of O
the O
insurance O
, O
and O
that O
appellees O
failed O
to O
notify O
the O
appellant O
of O
the O
increased O
hazard; O
and O
in O
the O
eighth O
plea O

policy O
there O
was O
a O
change O
of O
the O
ownership O
of O
the O
automobile O
in O
question O
, O
which O
was O
known O
to O
the O
appellees O
, O
and O
that O
they O
failed O
to O
notify O

of O
the O
change. O
The O
matters O
set O
up O
in O
the O
sixth O
, O
seventh O
and O
eighth O
plea O
embody O
all O
of O
the O
defenses O
which O
were O
urged O
on O
the O
trial O
to O
a O
recovery O
, O
except O
the O
point O
made O
in O
the O
second O
plea O
, O
to O
which O
demurrer O
was O
sustained O
, O
that O
the O
insured O
did O
not O
pay O
all O
of O

. O
There O
was O
a O

the O
appellees O
, O
fixing O
the O
amount O

, O
415. O
Thereafter O
there O
was O
a O
motion O
for O
a O
new O
trial O
by O
the O
appellant O
, O
which O
was O
denied O
, O
and O
a O

of O
the O
appellees O
and O
against O
the O
appellant O
for O
$1 O
, O
415 O
on O
the O
verdict. O
An O
appeal O
is O
prosecuted O
from O
the O
judgment O
. O
The O
proofs O
in O
the O
case O
show O
that O
David O
Robinson O
purchased O
the O
Stevens O
automobile O
in O
question O
from O
the O
appellees O
in O
the O
fall O
of O
1920 O
, O
to O
be O
delivered O
in O
the O
following O
spring; O
that O
the O
list O

of O
the O

was O
$2 O
, O

b. O
Springfield; O
that O
a.t O
about O
the O
date O
of O
the O
policy O
of O
insurance O
, O
namely O
, O
February O
21 O
, O
1921 O
, O
the O
automobile O
was O
delivered O
to O
him; O
that O
he O
turned O
in O
on O
the O
purchase O
price O
a O
Velie O
car O
at O
$775 O
and O
paid O
$100 O
in O
cash; O
that O
for O
the O
balance O
of O
the O
purchase O
price O
remaining O
due O
, O
namely O
, O
$1 O
, O
600 O
, O
he O
gave O
the O
appellee O
a O
note O
and O
chattel O
mortgage. O
Thereafter O
$185 O
was O
paid O
by O
Robinson O
and O
a O
renewal O
note O
for O
the O
balance O
due O
of O
*413$1 O
, O
415 O
was O
taken O
on O
August O
30 O
, O
1921 O
, O
which O
forms O
the O
basis O
of O
appellees\u2019 O
claim O
in O
this O
case. O
The O
owner O
of O
the O
insured O
car O
testified O
, O
concerning O
the O
theft O
of O
the O
car O
, O
that O
it O
was O
stolen O
in O
September O
, O
1921 O
, O
while O
he O
was O
absent O
from O
home O
, O
but O
that O
on O
the O
day O
of O
the O
night O
that O
the O
car O
was O
stolen O
it O
had O
been O
in O
charge O
of O
his O
brother O
, O
who O
, O
after O
driving O
it O
on O
that O
day O
, O
had O
left O
it O
on O
the O
lawn O
opposite O
the O
house O
that O
evening O
instead O
of O
putting O
it O
into O
the O
garage. O
He O
also O
testified O
that O
the O
car O
had O
not O
been O
used O
as O
a O
demonstrator O
car. O
The O
appellee O
, O
Ralph O
R. O
Lord O
, O
testified O
that O
the O
car O
in O
question O
had O
never O
been O
used O
as O
a O
demonstrator O
car O
to O
his O
knowledge O
, O
and O
that O
the O
car O
had O
never O
been O
used O
by O
Robinson O
for O
the O
appellees O
at O
any O
time. O
There O
was O
some O
evidence O
of O
conversations O
with O
Robinson O
and O
with O
Lord O
, O
from O
which O
the O
inference O
might O
be O
drawn O
that O
the O
car O
may O
have O
been O
used O
for O
the O
appellees O
, O
or O
used O
for O
other O
purposes O
than O
a O
pleasure O
ear O
, O
but O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
directly O
contradicting O
the O
facts O
testified O
to O
by O
the O
witnesses O
mentioned O
, O
and O
the O
witnesses O
mentioned O
denied O
having O
had O
the O
conversations. O
The O
jury O
were O
fully O
warranted O
in O
reaching O
the O
conclusion O
from O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
car O
had O
not O
been O
used O
as O
a. O
demonstrator O
car O
, O
and O
that O
the O
appellees O
had O
no O
knowledge O
that O
it O
had O
been O
used O
in O
that O
way; O
and O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
appellees O
had O
any O
knowledge O
, O
that O
the O
car O
had O
been O
left O
out O
on O
the O
lawn O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
stolen O
, O
nor O
at O
any O
other O
time. O
Error O
is O
assigned O
because O
the O
court O
sustained O
an O
objection O
to O
a O
question O
asked O
E. O
L. O
Conway O
, O
a O
witness O
for O
the O
defendant O
, O
who O
had O
been O
at O
one O
time O
in O
the O
employ O
of O
the O
appellees. O
The O
question O
was O
as O
follows: O
\u201cI O
will O
ask O
you O
whether O
or O
not O
using O
a O
car O
for O
demonstrating O
purpose O
is O
more O
hazardous O
or O
detrimental O
to O
its O
value O
than O
using O
it O
for O
pleasure O
purposes?\u201d O
The O
objection O
was O
properly O
sustained O
to O
this O
question. O
It O
does O
not O
appear O
that O
the O
witness O
possessed O
the O
necessary O
qualifications O
as O
an O
expert O
witness O
to O
answer O
the O
question O
, O
and O
the O
question O
itself O
involved O
a O
conclusion O
of O
the O
witness O
as O
to O
*414an O
ultimate O
fact O
, O
which O
was O
for O
the O
jury O
, O
and O
not O
the O
witness O
, O
to O
determine. O
Appellant O
complains O
that O
no O
evidence O
was O
introduced O
to O
show O
the O
cash O
value O
of O
the O
car; O
that O
under O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
policy O
the O
appellant O
company O
was O
not O
liable O
beyond O
the O
actual O
cash O
value O
of O
the O
automobile O
at O
the O
time O
it O
was O
stolen. O
It O
is O
sufficient O
to O
say O
, O
concerning O
this O
contention O
, O
that O
the O
policy O
which O
was O
introduced O
in O
evidence O
contains O
the O
following O
clause: O
\u201cIt O
is O
agreed O
and O
understood O
by O
and O
between O
the O
Company O
and O
the O
assured O
(and O
this O
policy O
is O
delivered O
and O
accepted O
, O
subject O
to O
such O
agreement) O
that O
the O
automobile O
and O
equipment O
, O
which O
is O
insured O
under O
this O
policy O
, O
shall O
be O
valued O
and O
insured O
during O
each O
month O
for O
the O
period O
covered O
by O
this O
policy O
, O
at O
an O
amount O
not O
to O
exceed O
a O
diminishment O
of O
25 O
per O
cent O
per O
year O
, O
or O
at O
this O
rate O
for O
any O
fractional O
part O
of O
the O
year O
during O
the O
life O
of O
this O
policy O
, O
commencing O
the O
same O
day O
of O
the O
month O
at O
noon O
, O
Central O
Standard O
Time O
, O
on O
the O
day O
on O
which O
the O
car O
was O
delivered O
to O
the O
assured O
as O
a O
new O
and O
unused O
car O
. O
\u201cThe O
value O
to O
be O
determined O
from O
the O
list O
price O
at O
date O
of O
purchase O
of O
the O
car O
as O
a O
new O
car.\u201d O
Under O
this O
clause O
the O
evidence O
shows O
that O
a O
prima O
facie O
case O
had O
been O
made O
out O
on O
the O
question O
of O
the O
value O
of O
the O
car. O
If O
there O
was O
any O
evidence O
that O
the O
actual O
cash O
value O
of O
the O
car O
stolen O
was O
less O
than O
the O
amount O
arrived O
at O
under O
the O
clause O
referred O
to O
, O
and O
less O
than O
the O
amount O
of O
appellees O
\u2019 O
claim O
, O
the O
introduction O
of O
such O
evidence O
was O
a O
matter O
of O
defense O
, O
and O
the O
presumption O
would O
be O
that O
there O
was O
no O
such O
evidence O
, O
otherwise O
the O
appellant O
would O
have O
availed O
itself O
of O
its O
right O
to O
introduce O
it O
. O
Error O
is O
also O
assigned O
on O
the O
sustaining O
of O
the O
demurrer O
to O
the O
second O
plea O
, O
in O
which O
it O
is O
alleged O
that O
the O
insured O
had O
not O
paid O
all O
the O
premium O
which O
was O
due O
on O
the O
policy O
in O
question; O
With O
reference O
to O
this O
matter O
, O
it O
is O
sufficient O
to O
say O
that O
the O
defense O
set O
up O
in O
the O
plea O
was O
not O
available O
to O
the O
appellant O
in O
this O
case. O

that O
in O
an O

They O
there O
maintained O
and O
managed O
their O
plant O
and O
had O
done O
so O
for O
about O
twenty-four O
years. O
The O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
had O
from O
time O
to O
time O
been O
filled O
in O
along O
the O
property O
of O
the O
appellant O
and O
adjoining O

so O
that O
on O
July O
3 O
, O
1921 O
, O
the O

from O
seventy O
to O
one-hundred O
feet O
farther O
west O
than O
it O
had O
been O
twenty-five O
years O
prior O
to O
that O
time. O
During O
June O
of O
1921 O
, O
Clarence O

of O
the O
bank O
and O
immediately O
to O
the O

Some O
piling O
had O
been O
driven O
along O

in O
1920. O
The O

This O
eddy O
extended O
north O
to O
the O
north O
line O
of O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
property. O
The O
evidence O
showed O
that O

an O
experienced O
oarsman O
and O
had O
considerable O
experience O
rowing O
boats O
on O
the O
Mississippi O
river O

on O
the O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
in O
the O
rear O
of O
*370the O
appellant\u2019s O
plant O
about O
every O
day O
that O
he O
was O
at O
work O
during O
the O
summer O
prior O
to O
the O
date O
of O
the O
accident O
; O
that O
he O
had O
lost O
no O
time O
but O
had O
been O
employed O
all O
the O
time O
at O
said O
plant O
excepting O
such O
times O
as O
the O
plant O
might O
not O
be O
working; O
that O
the O
plant O
was O
working O
regularly; O
that O
he O
saw O
none O
driven O
under O
the O
water; O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
any O
of O
the O
piling O
were O
submerged; O
that O
Theodore O
Erhart O
, O
a. O
director O
of O
the O
company O
, O
was O
standing O
on O
the O
bank O
of O
the O
river O
in O
the O
rear O
of O
said O
factory O
and O
saw O
two O
pilings O
driven O
by O
said O
Keokuk' O
Sand O
Company O
, O
and O
that O
neither O
of O
said O
piling O
was O
driven O
under O
water. O
That O
on O
the O
evening O
of O
July O
3 O
, O
1921 O
, O
the O
appellee O
, O
together O
with O
his O
wife O
, O
four O
children O
, O
the O
oldest O
one O
being O
ten O
years O
of O
age O
, O
the O
youngest O
about O
one O
year O
old O
, O
together O
with O
his O
nephew\u2019s O
wife O
and O
her O
baby O
of O
less O
than O
a O
year O
old O
, O
got O
into O
a O
boat O
belonging O
to O
the O
appellee O
some O
distance O
to O
the O
south O
of O
the O
plant O
of O
the O
appellant; O
that O
the O
boat O
was O
about O
eighteen O
feet O
long O
, O
a O
single O
bow-model O
boat O
and O
was O
about O
forty O
inches O
in O
width O
in O
the O
middle O
at O
the O
top; O
that O
after O
getting O
into O
the O
boat O
the O
appellee O
rowed O
the O
boat O
up O
the O
river; O
that O
he O
rowed O
near O
the O
bank O
and O
as O
he O
came O
up O
past O
the O
appellant\u2019s O
plant O
he O
saw O
the O
row O
of O
piling O
and O
turned O
out O
into O
the O
river O
to O
avoid O
them O
and O
, O
as O
he O
did O
so O
, O
the O
boat O
struck O
a O
submerged O
piling O
and O
capsized O
, O
all O
the O
occupants O
of O
the O
boat O
being O
thrown O
into O
the O
river; O
that O
certain O
of O
them O
were O
rescued; O
that O
other O
boats O
had O
struck O
against O
the O
submerged O
piling O
and O
that O
while O
dragging O
the O
river O
to O
find O
the O
bodies O
brick O
were O
placed O
on O
the O
top O
of O
the O
piling O
so O
that O
the O
place O
could O
be O
marked O
. O
It O
is O
contended O
by O
appellant O
that O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
showing O
that O
Norma O
Bardon O
is O
dead O
or O
that O
the O
accident O
was O
the O
proximate O
cause O
of O
her O
death. O
The O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
on O
this O
point O
is O
exceedingly O
meager. O
It O
shows O
that O
she O
was O
eleven O
years O
of O
age; O
that O
she O
was O
in O
the O
boat; O
that O
when O
the O
boat O
struck O
the O
submerged O
piling O
, O
all O
its O
occupants O
were O
thrown O
into O
the O
river O
, O
which O
was O
fifteen O
to O
twenty O
feet O
deep O
at O
that O
*371point; O
that O
certain O
persons O
were O
rescued O
, O
Norma O
not O
being O
named O
as O
one O
of O
those O
rescued; O
that O
thereafter O
the O
river O
was O
dragged O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
finding O
the O
bodies; O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
Norma O
was O
ever O
seen O
or O
heard O
of O
after O
the O
boat O
capsized O
. O
The O
suit O
was O
brought O
by O
the O
administrator O
of O
Norma O
Bardon O
, O
deceased O
, O
and O
the O
representative O
character O
of O
appellee O
is O
not O
challenged O
in O
the O
pleading. O
Bach O
count O
of O
the O
declaration O
set O
up O
the O
death O
of O
Norma O
Bardon O
as O
the O
result O
of O
the O
capsizing O
of O
the O
boat O
and O
this O
fact O
is O
not O
denied O
but O
is O
tacitly O
admitted O
by O
the O
special O

It O
was O
stipulated O
in O
the O
record O
on O
the O
trial O
that O
Norma O
Bardon O
left O
a O
brother O
, O
LeRoy O
Bardon O
, O
sixteen O
years O
of O
age; O
and O
Lorena O

nineteen O

The O
whole O
case O
was O
tried O
by O
both O
sides O
and O
the O
court O
on O
the O
theory O
that O
Norma O
was O
dead O
as O
the O
result O
of O
the O
accident O
and O
in O
a O
large O
number O
of O
the O
instructions O
given O
to O
the O
jury O
at O
the O
request O
of O
the O
defendant O
this O
fact O
is O
conceded. O
The O
record O
shows O
that O
on O
the O
trial O
one O
of O
the O
counsel O
for O
appellant O
said O
, O
in O
speaking O
of O
Norma O
, O
\u201cThere O
is O
absolutely O
no O
proof O
that O
this O
child O
that O
was O
drowned O
would O
contribute O
or O
would O
ever O
contribute O
anything O
to O
their O
support.\u201d O
When O
the O
question O
of O
the O
competency O
of O
certain O
evidence O
was O
raised O
, O
one O
of O
appellant\u2019s O
counsel O
said O
, O
\u201cThere O
is O
no O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
as O
I O
recollect O
that O
the O
young O
lady O
died. O
I O
was O
out O
of O
the O
room O
a O
part O
of O
the O
time O
, O
\u201d O
to O
which O
the O
court O
replied O
, O
\u201cAs O
I O
recall O
the O
testimony O
the O
children O
were O
drowned.\u201d O
The O
bill O
of O
exceptions O
shows O
the O
following: O
\u201cThe O
record O
may O
show O
that O
at O
the O
time O
C. O
H. O
Wood O
, O
one O
of O
the O
attorneys O
for O
the O
defendant O
in O
the O
argument O
on O
motion O
to O
exclude O
Wiggle-worth\u2019s O
Tables O
, O
stated O
to O
the O
court O
that O
there O
was O
no O
proof O
of O
death O
in O
the O
record O
, O
the O
court O
was O
under O
the O
*372impression O
that O
he O
meant O
a O
technical O
distinction O
between O
drowning O
and O
death O
, O
and O
the O
court O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
that O
there O
was O
proof O
in O
the O
record O
that O
the O
person O
for O
whose O
death O
suit O
had O
been O
brought O
had O
been O
drowned.\u201d O
It O
also O
shows O
\u201con O
the O
motion O
for O
a O
new O
trial O
, O
B. O
M. O
Cavanaugh O
, O
one O
of O
counsel O
for O
the O
defendant O
, O
stated O
in O
open O
court O
that O
he O
knew O
at O
the O
time O
the O
court O
made O
the O
above O
ruling O
that O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
either O
the O
drowning O
or O
death O
of O
the O
child O
for O
which O
this O
suit O
was O
brought.\u201d O
Under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
counsel O
cannot O
now O
be O
heard O
to O
urge O
that O
the O
jury O
were O
not O
warranted O
in O
finding O
that O
Norma O
Bardon O
came O
to O
her O
death O
by O
drowning O
as O
the O
result O
of O
the O
boat O
sinking O
upon O
the O
submerged O
piling O
. O
It O
is O
contended O
by O
appellant O
that O
the O
piling O
having O
been O
put O
in O
the O
river O
by O
an O
independent O
contractor O
, O
appellant O
cannot O
be O
held O
liable O
in O
this O
case. O
The O
evidence O
shows O
that O
the O
contractor O
had O
at O
no O
time O
exclusive O
possession O
of O
the O
premises. O
Some O
of O
the O
piling O
had O
been O
driven O
a O
year O
prior O
to O
the O
accident O
and O
the O
evidence O
tends O
to O
show O
that O
they O
were O
intended O
to O
be O
left O
there O
permanently O

*373Complaint O
is O
made O
by O
appellant O
that O
the O
court O
permitted O
appellee O
to O
introduce O
evidence O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
in O
several O
prior O
years O
rubbish O
had O
been O
dumped O
in O
the O
river O
adjacent O
to O
appellant\u2019s O
plant O
and O
the O
river O
filled O
in O
near O
the O
place O
of O
the O
accident. O
This O
evidence O
was O
not O
very O
material O
, O
but O
it O
did O
tend O
to O
show O
appellant\u2019s O
knowledge O
of O
the O
condition O
at O
the O
place O
in O
question O
and O
that O
it O
exercised O
proprietary O
acts O
over O
the O
bed O
of O
the O
stream O
at O
the O
place O
in O
question. O
It O
also O
might O
tend O
to O
show O
the O
purpose O
for O
which O
the O
piling O
were O
placed O
in O
the O
river. O
We O
find O
no O
reversible O
error O
in O
the O
admission O
of O
this O
evidence O
. O
It O
is O
contended O
by O
appellant O
that O
Peter O
Bardon O
, O
the O
father O
of O
Norma O
, O
was O
guilty O
of O
contributory O
negligence O
which O
would O
bar O
a O
recovery O
in O
this O
case. O
Peter O
Bardon O
testified O
that O
he O
did O
not O
know O
any O
of O
the O
piling O
were O
submerged O
and O
that O
at O
the O
time O
in O
question O
he O
turned O
the O
boat O
to O
avoid O
striking O
other O
piling O
which O
were O
not O
submerged. O
There O
was O
therefore O
some O
evidence O
that O
he O
was O
exercising O
some O
care O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
occupants O
of O
the O
boat O
and O
the O
jury O
had O
a O
right O
to O
find O
from O
the O
evidence O
in O
the O
case O
that O
the O
father O
was O
exercising O
ordinary O
care O
for O
the O
safety O
of O
the O
deceased O
. O
Complaint O
is O
made O
of O
the O
argument O
of O
counsel. O
While O
some O
of O
the O
remarks O
somewhat O
exceeded O
the O
limits O
of O
proper O
argument O
, O
the O
words O
which O
are O
shown O
by O
the O
abstract O
to O
have O
been O
objected O
to O
, O
and O
upon O
which O
the O
court O
ruled O
, O
were O
not O
objectionable O
. O
It O
is O
claimed O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
the O
giving O
and O
refusing O
instructions. O
The O
court O
gave O
to O
the O
jury O
thirty-two O
instructions O
, O
many O
of O
them O
quite O
lengthy. O
From O
an O
examination O
of O
the O
instructions O
given O
and O
refused O
, O
we O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
jury O
were O
instructed O
fully O
as O
favorably O
to O
the O
appellant O
as O
the O
law O
warranted O
and O
that O
the O
court O
committed O
no O
reversible O
error O

PRESIDING B-A
JUSTICE I-A
INGLIS I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Respondent O
, O
T.W. O
, O
appeals O
the O
order O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
*745Du O
Page O
County O
imposing O
upon O
him O
one O
year O
of O
supervision O
with O
conditions. O
The O
court O
imposed O
supervision O
following O
respondent\u2019s O
admission O
to O
the O
allegations O
in O
a O
petition O
for O
adjudication O
on O
a O
charge O
of O
burglary O
(720 O
ILCS O
5/19\u20141 O
(West O
1992)) O
. O
One O
of O
the O
conditions O
of O
this O
supervision O
was O
that O
respondent O
pay O
his O
share O
of O
restitution. O
The O
$700 O
total O
restitution O
included O
$160 O
for O
security O
lights O
installed O
by O
the O
victims O
after O
the O
burglary. O
Respondent O
contends O
that O
he O
cannot O
be O
made O
to O
pay O
for O
these O
lights O
as O
restitution. O
We O
agree O
and O
therefore O
modify O
the O
order O
as O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
restitution O
. O
The O
State O
contends O
initially O
that O
this O
court O
lacks O
jurisdiction O
to O
entertain O
this O
appeal O
, O
asserting O
that O
the O
imposition O
of O
conditional O
supervision O
is O
not O
final O
and O
appealable. O
We O
disagree. O
We O
have O
previously O
heard O
an O
appeal O
from O
a O
restitution O
order O
entered O
as O
conditions O
of O
a O
minor\u2019s O
supervision. O
(In O
re O
D.R. O
(1991) O
, O
219 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
13.) O
Thus O
, O
we O
address O
the O
merits O
of O
respondent\u2019s O
contention O
. O
Section O
5\u20145\u20146(a) O
of O
the O
Unified O
Code O
of O
Corrections O
provides O
that O
a O
court O
may O
order O
restitution O
"for O
out-of-pocket O
expenses O
, O
damages O
, O
losses O
, O
or O
injuries\u201d O
sustained O
by O
victims O
of O
a O
crime. O
(730 O
ILCS O
5/5\u20145\u20146(a) O
(West O
1992).) O
The O
statute O
does O
not O
provide O
for O
reimbursement O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
security O
measures O
added O
by O
a O
victim O
following O
the O
commission O
of O
an O
offense O
. O
The O
State O
argues O
that O
an O
intent O
to O
include O
such O
expenses O
in O
the O
term O
"restitution\u201d O
may O
be O
inferred O
from O
paragraph O
(g) O
of O
the O
restitution O
statute O
, O
which O
provides O
that O
sex O
offenders O
may O
be O
made O
to O
pay O
therapy O
expenses O
of O
their O
victims. O
(730 O
ILCS O
5/5\u20145\u20146(g) O
(West O
1992).) O
We O
disagree. O
Therapy O
for O
victims O
of O
sex O
offenses O
is O
a O
permitted O
restitution O
item; O
security O
devices O
for O
burglary O
victims O
are O
not O
. O
The O
trial O
court O
abused O
its O
discretion O
in O
ordering O
respondent O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
security O
lights O
installed O
by O
the O
victims O
, O
because O
such O
expenses O
are O
not O
compensable O
by O
restitution. O
We O
therefore O
modify O
the O
restitution O
order O
, O
per O
our O
authority O
under O
Supreme O
Court O
Rule O
615(b) O
(134 O
Ill. O
2d O
R. O
615(b)) O
, O
and O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
restitution O
from O
$700 O
to O
$540 O
. O

*891This O
action O
arose O
from O
plaintiff\u2019s O
purchase O
of O
a O
new O
automobile O
from O
defendant O
Elmhurst O
Motors. O
On O
December O
29 O
, O
1987 O
, O
plaintiff O
filed O
a O
three-count O
complaint O
against O
defendants O
alleging O
that O
she O
had O
been O
induced O
to O
purchase O
a O
new O
Ford O
automobile O
from O
defendant O
Elmhurst O
Motors O
whereupon O
defendant O
promised O
her O
certain O
financing O
and O
payment O
terms. O
Plaintiff O
alleged O
that O
defendant O
Elmhurst O
Motors O
gave O
her O
possession O
of O
the O
new O
automobile O
and O
took O
her O
old O
trade-in O
automobile O
before O
the O
financing O
agreement O
was O
signed. O
Plaintiff O
alleged O
that O
when O
she O
returned O
to O
the O
dealership O
to O
sign O
the O
financing O
agreement O
, O
she O
was O
told O
that O
the O
promised O
financing O
terms O
were O
not O
available O
and O
that O
she O
had O
no O
alternative O
but O
to O
sign O
a O
more O
expensive O
financing O
agreement O
because O
she O
had O
already O
taken O
possession O
of O
the O
new O
automobile O
and O
defendant O
had O
already O
sold O
her O
trade-in. O
Although O
plaintiff O
was O
upset O
, O
she O
signed O
the O
agreement O
as O
directed O
. O
In O
December O
of O
1988 O
, O
defendant O
Ford O
Credit O
filed O
a O
counterclaim O
for O
breach O
of O
its O
finance O
agreement O
with O
plaintiff. O
On O
January O
23 O
, O
1989 O
, O
plaintiff O
filed O
an O

named O

The O

complaint O
also O
included O
allegations O
and O
a O
prayer O
for O
relief O
on O

of O
a O
class O
. O
In O
early O
1989 O
, O
, O
plaintiff O
sought O
supplemental O
discovery O
and O
class O
certification. O
On O
September O

, O
a O

1989 O
, O
were O
set O
for O

pending O
discovery O

motions. O
During O
the O
latter O
part O
of O
1989 O
, O
there O
were O
also O
ongoing O
settlement O
negotiations O
between O
the O
parties O
. O
The O
event O
which O
gave O
rise O
to O
this O
appeal O
occurred O
on O
March O
13 O
, O
1990. O
On O
that O
date O
, O
plaintiff\u2019s O
claims O
and O
defendant O

counterclaims O
were O
dismissed O

(DWP\u2019d) O
during O
a O

, O
at O
which O
none O

The O

not O

May O
of O

On O
May O

that O
a O

payable O
to O
vacate O
the O
DWP O

should O
be O
paid O
to O
the O

Plaintiff O
paid O
the O

On O
May O

, O
1991 O
, O
plaintiff O
filed O
a O
section O

\u2014 O
1401 O
petition O
which O
was O
written O
on O
the O
assumption O
that O

had O
missed O
a O

The O
trial O
court O
granted O
plaintiff\u2019s O
motion O
to O
vacate O
the O

order. O
Defendants O
then O
filed O
a O
notice O
of O

With O
regard O
to O
the O
first O
criterion O
, O
we O
hold O
that O
the O
complaint O
is O
meritorious. O
The O
allegations O
that O
defendants O
compelled O
prospective O
purchasers O
to O
agree O
to O
financing O
terms O
that O
were O
materially O
different O
from O
the O
terms O
originally O
agreed O
upon O
by O
the O
parties O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
that O
the O
automobiles O
traded O
in O
by O
the O
purchasers O
were O
resold O
soon O
after O
the O
purchasers O
took O
possession O
of O
their O
new O
automobiles O
, O
but O
before O
financing O
was O
approved O
, O
constitute O
an O
actionable O
claim O
. O
In O
regard O
to O
the O
second O
criterion O
, O
defendants O
allege O
that O
plaintiff O
failed O
to O
exercise O
due O
diligence O
as O
evidenced O
by O
plaintiff\u2019s O
inaction O
between O
March O
19 O
, O
1990 O
, O
and O
May O
14 O
, O
1991 O
, O
the O
dates O
upon O
which O
letters O
discussing O
a O
possible O
settlement O
were O
drafted. O
The O
record O
, O
however O
, O
suggests O
that O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
dismissal O
, O
plaintiff O
exercised O
due O
diligence. O
Plaintiff O
defended O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
, O
took O
discovery O
depositions O
, O
argued O
in O
support O
of O
her O
leave O
to O
amend O
her O
complaint O
based O
upon O
preliminary O
discovery O
, O
amended O
her O
complaint O
, O
took O
further O
discovery O
depositions O
and O
filed O
motions O
for O
class O
certification. O
Around O
the O
time O
of O
the O
calendar O
call O
and O
the O
time O
plaintiff O
became O
aware O
that O
a O
dismissal O
order O
had O
been O
entered O
in O
the O
case O
, O
plaintiff O
was O
engaged O
in O
settlement O
negotiations O
with O
defendants. O
Plaintiff O
also O
filed O
a O
section O
2 O
\u2014 O
1401 O
petition O
immediately O
after O
learning O
that O
a O
dismissal O
order O
had O
been O
entered O
in O
her O
case. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
hold O
that O
plaintiff O
exercised O
due O
diligence O
and O
presented O
a O
meritorious O
defense O
. O
For O
the O
above O
reasons O
, O
this O

a O

pursuant O

a O

the O

signed O

(the O

However O
, O
the O

showed O
that O
no O

On O
November O
6 O
, O
1991 O
, O
the O
State O
filed O
a O
complaint O
to O
collect O

Act O
(the O

, O
Bernice O
Boeger O
, O
both O
personally O
and O
as O

of O
the O

of O
Harvey O
Boeger. O
The O
complaint O
alleged O
that O
, O
on O
May O
8 O
, O
1991 O
, O
the O
State O
had O
made O
a O
request O
to O
the O

to O
file O
a O
supplemental O
tax O
return O
and O
pay O
the O
additional O
tax O
of O
$12 O
, O
851.59 O
, O
and O
that O
, O
as O
of O
the O
date O
of O
the O
filing O
of O
the O
complaint O
, O
the O
additional O
tax O
due O
had O
not O
been O
paid. O
The O
complaint O
sought O
judgment O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$12 O
, O
851.59 O
plus O
interest O
and O
penalties O
as O
provided O
by O
the O
Act O
. O
The O
Estate O
filed O
its O
answer O
and O
admitted O
that O
an O
additional O
tax O
was O
due O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$12 O
, O
851.59. O
The O
Estate O
alleged O
that O
, O
on O
May O
15 O
, O
1992 O
, O
it O
paid O
the O
amount O
due O
and O
attached O
a O

of O
the O

as O
an O
exhibit O
to O
the O
answer O
showing O
that O
the O

had O
been O
paid. O
The O
Estate O
requested O
that O
the O
complaint O
be O
dismissed O
. O
The O
State O
filed O
a O
motion O
for O
summary O
judgment O
to O
collect O
interest O
and O
penalties O
on O
the O
additional O
tax O
due. O
In O
response O
to O
the O
motion O
for O
summary O
judgment O
, O
the O
Estate O
set O
forth O
facts O
showing O
that O
on O
May O
15 O
, O
1992 O
, O
it O
paid O
the O
additional O
tax O
and O
that O
on O
November O
16 O

1992 O
, O
it O
filed O
the O
supplemental O
return O
and O
paid O
the O
interest O
on O
the O
additional O
tax. O
The O
Estate O
argued: O
(1) O
that O
the O
IRS O
waived O
penalties O
by O
not O
assessing O
any O
penalties O
for O
the O
late O
filing O
or O
late O
payment O
by O
the O
Estate O
of O
any O
taxes; O
and O
(2) O
that O
this O

constituted O
reasonable O

within O
the O
meaning O
of O

8(d)(1) O
of O
the O
Act O
(35 O

the O

of O
the O

Although O
no O

decide O
this O
appeal O
under O
the O
guidelines O
established O

(1976) O
, O

The O
State\u2019s O
first O
argument O
on O
appeal O
is O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
erred O
in O
construing O
the O
nonassessment O
of O
penalties O
by O
the O
IRS O
as O
a O
waiver O
of O
penalties O
and O
granting O
the O
Estate\u2019s O
motion O
for O
summary O
judgment. O
The O
State O
argues O
that O
no O
penalties O
were O
assessed O
by O
the O
IRS O
because O
no O
penalties O
were O
available O
to O
be O
assessed O
by O
the O
IRS O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
acceptance O
of O
the O
report O
of O
estate O
tax O
examination O
changes. O
The O
State O
argues O
that O
the O
nonassessment O
of O
penalties O
by O
the O
*749IRS O
should O
not O
be O
considered O
a O
waiver O
of O
penalties O
for O
purposes O
of O
the O
State O
return O
. O
The O
Act O
specifies O
that O
, O
generally O
, O
the O
due O
date O
for O
filing O
the O
State O
return O
or O
paying O
the O
State O
tax O
is O
the O
due O
date O
or O
dates O
for O
filing O
the O
related O
Federal O
return. O
(35 O
ILCS O
405/6 O
(West O

However O
, O
section O
7 O
of O
the O
Act O
(35 O
ILCS O
405/7 O
(West O
1992)) O
places O
an O
affirmative O
duty O
on O
the O
taxpayer O
to O
file O
a O
supplemental O
Illinois O
transfer O
tax O
return O
and O
pay O
additional O
tax O
where O
the O
State O
tax O
credit O
is O
increased O
after O
the O
filing O
of O
the O
Illinois O
transfer O
tax O
return. O
Under O
section O
7 O
of O
the O
Act O
, O
the O
due O
date O
for O
the O
filing O
of O
the O
supplemental O
return O
and O
paying O
the O
additional O
tax O
is O
three O
months O
after O
the O
earliest O
of: O
(1) O
the O
date O
an O
amended O
related O
Federal O
return O
is O
filed; O
(2) O
the O
date O
an O
increase O
in O
the O
Federal O
transfer O
tax O
is O
paid O
or O
accepted O
in O
writing; O
or O
(3) O
the O
date O
the O
IRS O
issues O
a O
request O
for O
evidence O
of O
payment O
of O
the O
State O
tax O
credit O
. O
In O
the O
present O
case O
, O
the O
State O
tax O
credit O
was O
increased O
by O
the O
acceptance O
of O
the O
overassessment. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
Estate O
had O
a O
duty O
to O
file O
a O
supplemental O
return O
and O
pay O
the O
additional O
tax. O
(See O
35 O
ILCS O
405/7 O
(West O
1992).) O
The O
Estate O
admitted O
in O
its O
answer O
to O
the O
State\u2019s O
motion O
for O
summary O
judgment O
that O
it O
paid O
the O
additional O
tax O
due O
the O
IRS O
at O
the O
time O
the O
amount O
due O
was O
settled O
with O
the O
IRS. O
At O
the O
latest O
, O
this O
would O
have O
been O
on O
August O
9 O
, O
1990 O
, O
when O
the O
acceptance O
of O
the O
overassessment O
was O
signed. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
additional O
tax O
was O
due O
the O
State O
by O
November O
9 O
, O
1990. O

Since O
the O

was O
not O
paid O
until O
May O
15 O

1992 O
, O
and O
the O
supplemental O

was O
not O
filed O
until O
November O

the O

to O
a O
reasonable O
cause. O
(See O
35 O
ILCS O

(West O

The O
Estate O
argued O
in O
the O
trial O
court O
that O
the O
IRS\u2019s O
failure O
to O
assess O
any O
penalties O
on O
the O
report O
of O
tax O
examination O
changes O
of O
August O
9 O
, O
1990 O
, O
was O
a O
waiver O
of O
penalties O
for O
the O
late O
filing O
and O
payment O
of O
the O
additional O
taxes O
and O
that O
this O
constituted O
reasonable O
cause O
under O
section O
8(d)(1) O
of O
the O
Act O
quoted O
above. O
See O
35 O
ILCS O
405/8(d)(l) O
(West O
1992) O
. O
However O
, O
the O
Estate O
admitted O
that O
it O
paid O
the O
IRS O
its O
additional O
tax O
due O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
report O
of O
tax O
examination O
changes. O
Therefore O
, O
the O
IRS O
could O
not O
have O
assessed O
any O
penalties O
at O
that O
time O
for O
late O
payment. O
Moreover O
, O
the O
record O
does O
not O
indicate O
that O
the O
IRS O
could O
have O
ever O
assessed O
any O
penalties O
against O
the O
Estate. O
Therefore O
, O
there O
was O
no O
penalty O
for O
the O
related O
Federal O
tax O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
section O
8(d)(1) O
of O
the O
Act. O
Since O
there O
was O
no O
penalty O
for O
the O
related O
Federal O
tax O
, O
the O
nonassessment O
of O
penalties O
in O
the O
report O
of O
tax O
examination O
changes O
was O
not O
a O
waiver O
of O
that O
penalty O
under O
section O
8(d)(1) O
of O
the O
Act O
and O
did O
not O
constitute O
reasonable O
cause O
for O
purposes O

section O
8 O
of O
the O
Act; O
it O
was O
merely O
a O
statement O
that O
no O
penalties O
were O
applicable O
. O
Summary O
judgment O
is O
proper O
where O
the O
pleadings O
, O
depositions O
, O
and O
admissions O
on O
file O
, O
together O
with O
the O
affidavits O

if O
any O
, O
show O
that O
there O
is O
no O
genuine O

(735 O

We O
find O
as O
a O

that O
the O
nonassessment O

was O
not O

The O
State\u2019s O
next O
argument O

that O
the O
trial O

erred O

admitted O
that O

the O

JUSTICE B-A

delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
The O
defendant O
, O
Roderick O
Baker O
, O
was O
charged O
by O
information O
with O
harassment O
by O
telephone O
(720 O
ILCS O
135/1 O
\u2014 O
1(2) O
(West O

The O
defendant O
subsequently O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
for O
lack O
of O
jurisdiction. O
At O
a O
hearing O
on O
the O
motion O
, O
it O
was O
stipulated O
that O
the O
defendant O
was O
in O
Ohio O
when O
he O
placed O
the O
telephone O
call O
that O
formed O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
charge. O
The O
trial O
court O
dismissed O
the O
charge O
, O
specifically O
finding O
that O
"the O
conduct O
which O
formed O
the O
basis O
for O
the O
charge O
had O
taken O
place O
entirely O
in O
the O
State O
of O
Ohio.\u201d O
On O
appeal O
, O
the O
State O
argues O
that O
jurisdiction O
was O
proper O
in O
Illinois O
because O
the O
offense O
was O
committed O
partly O
in O
Illinois O
. O
The O
Illinois O
jurisdiction O
statute O
provides: O
"(a) O
A O
person O
is O
subject O
to O
pros\u00e9cution O
in O
this O
State O

an O

he O
commits O
, O
while O
either O

the O
State O
, O
*** O

is O
committed O
either O

State; O

An O

if O
either O
the O

an O
element O
of O
the O

, O
or O
the O
result O
which O

We O
do O
not O
dispute O
the O
circuit O
court\u2019s O
conclusion O
that O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
conduct O
occurred O
entirely O
in O
the O
State O
of O
Ohio. O
However O
, O
the O
alleged O
result O
of O
that O
conduct O
was O
harassment O
in O
Illinois. O
Thus O
, O
for O
jurisdictional O
purposes O
, O
the O
offense O
was O
committed O
partly O
in O
Illinois. O
Jurisdiction O
was O
therefore O
proper O
in O

We O
note O
that O
our O
conclusion O
is O
consistent O
with O
that O
reached O
in O
the O
factually O
similar O
case O
of O
Brehm O
v. O
Indiana O
(Ind. O
Ct. O
App. O
1990) O
, O
558 O
N.E.2d O
906. O
In O
Brehm O
, O
the O
defendant O
placed O
harassing O
telephone O
calls O
from O
Michigan O
, O
where O
he O
lived O
, O
to O
his O
ex-wife O
in O
Indiana. O
At O
the O
time O
, O
Indiana O
had O
harassment O
and O
jurisdictional O
statutes O
substantially O
similar O
to O
the O
Illinois O
statutes O
cited O
above. O
(See O
Brehm O
, O
558 O
N.E.2d O
at O
908.) O
The O
Brehm O
court O
concluded O
that O
Indiana O
had O
jurisdiction O
because O
the O
intimidation O
resulting O
from O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
telephone O
calls O
manifested O
itself O
in O
Indiana O
. O
Finally O
, O
we O
note O
that O
Illinois O
has O
a O
valid O
public O
interest O
in O
protecting O
people O
in O
Illinois O
from O
harassing O
telephone O
calls O
originating O
outside O
the O
State. O
Accordingly O
, O
our O
decision O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
legislative O
purpose O
of O
the O
jurisdiction O
statute O
, O
which O
is O
to O
establish O
"a O
broad O
jurisdictional O
basis O
for O
the O
prosecution O
in O
Illinois O
of O
offenses O
involving O
persons O
, O
property O
, O
and O
public O
interests O
in O
the O

In O
1990 O
, O
Frank O
DeFranza O
, O
the O
president O
of O
Environetics O
, O
contacted O
Rose-Tillmann O

Midwestern O
contacted O
Lexington O
, O
which O
issued O
a O
policy O
to O
Environetics O
in O
November O
1990 O
. O
Environetics O
sent O
its O
gross O
premium O
plus O
surplus O
lines O
tax O
and O
stamping O
fee O
of O
$46 O
, O
700 O
to O
Rose-Tillmann. O
Rose-Tillmann O
took O
a O
$2 O
, O
000 O
commission O
and O
passed O
on O
the O
premium O
to O
National O
Risk. O
National O

which O
took O
a O
commission O
and O
passed O
on O
the O
remaining O
$40 O
, O
700 O
to O
Lexington O
. O
In O
June O
1991 O
, O
Environetics O
received O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
insurance O
policy O
from O
Lexington. O
The O
policy O
did O
not O
cover O
much O
of O
the O
activities O
of O
Environetics O
and O
contained O
a O
number O
of O
provisions O
that O
were O
not O
disclosed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
purchase. O
On O
September O
20 O
, O
1991 O
, O
the O
attorney O
for O
Environetics O
wrote O
letters O
to O
Rose-Tillmann O
and O
Lexington O
, O
demanding O
a O
full O
refund O
of O
the O
premium O
and O
of O
the O
taxes O
and O
fees O
paid O
to O
secure O
the O
policy. O
The O
amount O
demanded O
was O
$46 O
, O
700 O
. O
Ten O
days O
later O
, O
Lexington\u2019s O
senior O
vice-president O
, O
Richard O
H. O
Bucilla O
, O
said O
by O
letter O
that O
Environetics O
should O
be O
"looking O
somewhere O
else\u201d O
for O
someone O
to O
blame O
for O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
policy O
was O
not O
the O
one O
Environetics O
wanted O
but O
agreed O
to O
settle O
if O
Environetics O
would O
return O
the O
policy O
through O
its O
"broker\u201d O
for O
flat O
cancellation O
, O
with O
a O
cover O
letter O
releasing O
Lexington; O
Lexington O
would O
then O
instruct O
its O
agent O
Midwestern O
to O
return O
the O
premium O
through O
Envi-ronetics\u2019 O
"broker.\u201d O
The O
offer O
by O
Bucilla O
was O
accepted O
by O
Environetics O
through O
a O
letter O
from O
its O
attorney O
on O
October O
8 O
, O
1991. O
That O
letter O
informed O
Bucilla O
that O
Environetics O
had O
"already O
notified O
Rose-Tillmann\u2019s O
attorney O
of O
Environetics\u2019 O
intention.\u201d O
An O
attorney O
for O
Rose-Tillmann O
accepted O
the O
settlement O
in O
a O
letter O
of O
October O
18 O
, O
1991 O
, O
to O
Bucilla O
, O
a O
copy O
of O
which O
was O
sent O
to O
the O
attorney O
for O
Environetics O
. O
On O
November O
8 O
, O
1991 O
, O
Environetics O
returned O
the O
policy O
to O
Rose-Tillmann O
, O
along O
with O
a O
cover O
letter O
which O
cancelled O
the O
policy O
, O
"pursuant O
to O
[Environetics\u2019] O
agreement O
with O

, O
and O
in O

all O

on O
this O

Rose-Tillmann O
returned O
the O
policy O
to O
National O
Risk O
, O
which O
returned O
it O
to O
Midwestern O
, O
which O
returned O
it O
to O
Lexington O
. O
Environetics O
never O
received O
any O
money O
from O
Lexington O
and O
filed O
a O
three-count O
complaint O
against O
Lexington O
, O
Rose-Tillmann O
, O
Midwestern O
and O
National O
Risk. O
Lexington O
and O
Midwestern O
filed O
a O
counterclaim O
against O
Rose-Tillmann O
, O
seeking O
a O
declaration O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
was O
responsible O
to O
pay O
the O
return O
premium O
and O
sought O
indemnification O
from O
Rose-Tillmann. O
Rose-Tillmann O
cross-claimed O
against O
Lexington O
and O
Midwestern O
, O
also O
asserting O
a O
right O
to O
indemnification. O
Rose-Tillmann O
returned O
its O
$2 O
, O
000 O
commission O
to O
*283the O
plaintiff. O
National O
Risk O
filed O
for O
bankruptcy O
after O
the O
complaint O
was O
filed. O
It O
is O
the O
insolvency O
of O
National O
Risk O
that O
is O
the O
root O
of O
the O
controversy O
. O
The O
judge O
granted O
summary O
judgment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
against O
Lexington O
and O
Rose-Tillmann O
, O
jointly O
and O
severally; O
he O
also O
entered O
summary O
judgment O
in O
favor O
of O
Rose-Tillmann O
and O
against O
Lexington O
on O
Rose-Tillmann\u2019s O
claim O
for O
indemnification O
. O
After O
examining O
the O
complaint O
, O
exhibits O
, O
affidavits O
and O
answer O
to O
interrogatories O
, O
we O
conclude O
that O
Lexington O
kept O
the O
cash O
it O
ultimately O
received O
from O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
that O
Lexington O
considered O
that O
its O
obligation O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
was O
satisfied O
by O
book O
entries O
of O
credit O
and O
debit O
. O
In O
his O
affidavit O
, O
Richard O
Gundlach O
, O
a O
vice-president O
of O
Midwestern O
, O
described O
the O
path O
of O
what O
he O
considered O
a O
return O
of O
the O
premium. O
National O
Risk O
delivered O
to O
Midwestern O
a O
check O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$99 O
, O
851.20 O
, O
which O
included O
the O
notation O
, O
"Robinette O
Demolition O
less O
Environetics.\u201d O
Robinette O
Demolition O
was O
another O
insured O
on O
whose O
behalf O
National O
Risk O
had O
sought O
and O
received O
coverage O
from O
Lexington O
through O
Midwestern. O
According O
to O
Gundlach O
, O
Lexington O
and O
Midwestern O
paid O
the O
premium O
to O
National O
Risk O
when O
National O
Risk O
reduced O
an O
amount O
payable O
to O
Midwestern O
by O
$40 O
, O
766.40. O
By O
so O
giving O
credit O
to O
National O
Risk O
, O
Lexington O
fulfilled O
its O
obligation O
to O
the O
plaintiff. O
About O
six O
weeks O
after O
the O
"settlement\u201d O
between O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
Rose-Tillmann O
and O
Lexington O
, O
Gundlach O
learned O
that O
National O
Risk O
was O
having O
financial O
difficulties O
. O
The O
plaintiff O
did O
not O
have O
notice O
of O
and O
did O
not O
agree O
to O
Lexington O
using O
a O
credit O
and O
debit O
system O
of O
payment. O
All O
parties O
agree O
that O
the O
issue O
is O
whether O
the O
parties O
agreed O
to O
the O
manner O
of O
payment O
now O
advanced O
by O
Lexington O
. O
The O
language O
of O
the O
agreement O
is O
neither O
lengthy O
nor O
complex: O
Lexington O
, O
which O
made O
the O
offer O
, O
said O
it O
would O
instruct O
Midwestern O
"to O
return O
the O
premium O
through\u201d O
Rose-Tillmann. O
(Emphasis O
added.) O
Lexington O
required O
the O
plaintiff O
to O
return O
the O
policy O
through O
Rose-Tillmann. O
We O
have O
emphasized O
"the O
premium\u201d O
because O
no O
reasonable O
person O
would O
construe O
that O
phrase O
to O
mean O
anything O
but O
cash O
or O
a O
check O
in O
the O
sum O
of O
$46 O
, O
700. O
We O
also O
point O
out O
that O
it O
was O
Lexington O
which O
insisted O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
turn O
over O
the O
policy O
to O
Rose-Tillmann O
and O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
would O
be O
the O
conduit O
through O
which O
the O
plaintiff O
would O
receive O
the O
premium. O
In O
short O
, O
it O
was O
Lexington O
, O
not O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
which O
brought O
Rose-Tillmann O
into O
the O
cancellation O
and O
return O
process O
. O
At O
this O
point O
, O
it O
is O
appropriate O
to O
address O
an O
argument O
made O
by O
Lexington O
in O
its O
reply O
brief O
in O
which O
it O
maintains O
that O
when O
Bucilla O
*284said O
in O
his O
offer O
of O
settlement O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
was O
to O
return O
the O
policy O
through O
the O
plaintiff\u2019s O
"broker O
, O
\u201d O
he O
was O
referring O
to O
National O
Risk O
, O
not O
Rose-Tillmann. O
We O
reject O
that O
belated O
argument. O
The O
record O
clearly O
refutes O
it. O
On O
October O
8 O
, O
1991 O
, O
in O
response O
to O
Bucilla\u2019s O
offer O
of O
September O
30 O
, O
1991 O
, O
the O
attorney O
for O
Lexington O
informed O
him O
by O
letter O
that O
he O
would O
send O
the O
requested O
cancellation O
and O
release O
"and O
the O
policy O
to O
Rose-Tillmann.\u201d O
The O
attorney O
for O

wrote O
to O

on O
October O
18 O

, O

by O

and O
the O
plaintiff. O
Indeed O
, O
in O
Lexington\u2019s O
cross-claim O
, O
it O
was O
alleged: O
"On O
or O
about O
October O
8 O
, O
1991 O
, O
Rose-Tillmann O
, O
acting O
on O
behalf O
of O
plaintiff O
and O
within O
the O
scope O
of O
its O
agency O
, O
agreed O
with O
Lexington O
and O
Midwestern O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
would O
pay O
the O
return O
premium O
to O
plaintiff O
, O
with O
respect O
to O
a O
liability O
insurance O
policy O
issued O
to O
Environetics O
by O
Lexington.\u201d O
The O
plaintiff O
followed O
the O
agreement O
to O
the O
letter. O
It O
returned O
the O
policy O
to O
Rose-Tillmann O
along O
with O
a O
cover O
letter O
which O
cancelled O
the O
policy O
"pursuant O
to O
our O
[Environetics\u2019] O
agreement O
with O

, O
and O

by O
us O
on O
this O
policy.\u201d O
Rose-Tillmann O
also O
followed O
the O
agreement O
to O
the O
letter. O
In O
sum O
, O
the O
judge O
held O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
that O
the O
agreement O
required O
Lexington O
to O
return O
a O
sum O
of O
money O
to O
the O
plaintiff; O
that O
Lexington O
did O
not O
do O
so; O
and O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
performed O
its O
end O
of O
the O
agreement. O
We O
agree O
. O
Lexington O
has O
raised O
other O
arguments O
which O
we O
will O
address O
briefly. O
It O
says O
that O
the O
judge O
ignored O
the O
fact O
that O
Midwestern O
was O
also O
part O
of O
the O
agreement O
and O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
is O
bound O
by O
its O
agent O
Rose-Tillmann\u2019s O
inclusion O
of O
National O
Risk O
in O
the O
settlement O
agreement. O
Lexington O
also O
points O
out O
that O
in O
Gundlach\u2019s O
affidavit O
he O
said O
that O
Midwestern O
"understood O
that O
National O
Risk O
was O
a O
party O
to O
the O
settlement.\u201d O
In O
response O
, O
we O
say O
that O
whether O
Lexington O
considered O
Midwestern O
part O
of O
the O
agreement O
and O
whether O
Midwestern O
understood O
that O
National O
Risk O
was O
a O
party O
to O
the O
settlement O
are O
apropos O
of O
nothing O
at O
all O
when O
we O
consider O
the O
face O
of O
the O
agreement. O
Rose-Tillmann O
could O
not O
and O
did O
not O
include O
National O
Risk O
in O
the O
settlement O
agreement O
simply O
by O
forwarding O
the O
policy O
to O
National O
Risk O
. O
Lexington O
repeatedly O
asserts O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
and O
National O
Risk O
were O
the O
agents O
of O
the O
plaintiff; O
that O
these O
agents O
agreed O
to O
the O
*285bookkeeping O
entry O
method O
of O
repayment O
and O
thereby O
bound O
the O
plaintiff. O

In O
that O

, O

commissioned O
a O

to O

policy O
to O
the O
plaintiff O
with O
his O
own O
bill O
for O
the O
premium. O
The O
plaintiffs O
paid O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
premium O
to O
the O
broker. O
Six O
months O
later O
, O
the O
plaintiffs O
forwarded O
the O
policy O
to O
the O
broker O
and O
ordered O
him O
to O
surrender O
it O
to O
the O
defendant O
for O
cancellation. O
At O
the O
time O
there O
was O
an O
unearned O
premium O
, O
which O
the O
defendant O
insurer O
credited O
to O
the O
broker\u2019s O
account O
. O
The O
attorneys O
for O
the O
broker O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
entered O
into O
a O
settlement O
agreement O
by O
which O
the O
broker O
was O
to O
reimburse O
the O
plaintiff. O
The O
broker O
breached O
the O
agreement O
, O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
sued O
the O
defendant O
insurer. O
The O
appellate O
court O
affirmed O
the O
judgment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
insurer O
. O
Frankly O
, O
we O
are O
at O
a O
loss O
to O
understand O
why O
Lexington O
cites O
this O
case; O
it O
is O
authority O
for O
the O
plaintiff\u2019s O
position O
here. O
First O
, O
the O
broker O
in O
Middle O
Western O
got O
the O
unearned O
premium O
in O
the O
form O
of O
the O
credit. O
Rose-Tillmann O
did O
not O
get O
the O
return O
premium. O
Second O
, O
the O
court O
held O
that O
the O
broker O
acted O
outside O
the O
scope O
of O
his O
authority O
by O
retaining O
the O
amount O
due O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
but O
that O
the O
plaintiffs O
by O
their O
subsequent O
conduct O
in O
entering O
into O
a O
settlement O
agreement O
with O
the O
broker O
ratified O
the O
actions O
of O
the O
broker O
. O
In O
the O
case O
before O
us O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
did O
not O
ratify O
any O
actions O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
might O
have O
taken O
in O
the O
transaction. O
Indeed O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
immediately O
notified O
Lexington O
and O
Rose-Tillmann O
that O
it O
would O
hold O
both O
of O
them O
accountable O
for O
the O
return O
of O
the O
premium O
. O
Anticipating O
that O
Lexington O
may O
urge O
that O
National O
Risk O
acted O
as O
the O
broker O
did O
in O
Middle O
Western O
, O
we O
wish O
to O
make O
our O
holding O
clear O
that O
Lexington O
has O
failed O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
to O
show O
that O
National O
Risk O
was O
an O
agent O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
acting O
in O
the O
scope O
of O
its O
authority O
when O
it O
claimed O
a O
credit O
for O
an O
amount O
due O
its O
principal O
, O
if O
there O
was O
in O
fact O
ever O
any O
agency O
relationship O
between O
National O
Risk O
and O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
the O
procurement O
of O
the O
policy. O
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
the O
judgment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
and O
against O
Lexington O
is O
affirmed O
. O
We O
turn O
now O
to O
Lexington\u2019s O
claim O
that O
the O
judge O
erred O
in O
granting O
summary O
judgment O
to O
Rose-Tillmann O
on O
Rose-Tillmann\u2019s O
claim O
for O
indemnity O
from O
Lexington. O
Lexington O
maintains O
that O
"there O
are O
disputed O
issues O
of O
fact O
as O
to O
whether O
Lexington O
breached O
the O
settlement O
agreement O
, O
thereby O
causing O
Rose-Tillmann O
to O
fail O
to O
pay O
Envi-*286ronetics.\u201d O
Lexington O
also O
maintains O
that O
there O
are O
issues O
of O
material O
fact O
as O
to O
whether O
Rose-Tillmann O
was O
"without O
fault O
in O
fact.\u201d O
For O
reasons O
already O
expressed O
, O
we O
repeat O
that O
the O
record O
shows O
that O
Lexington O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
, O
breached O
the O
settlement O
agreement. O
The O
basis O
of O
Lexington\u2019s O
second O
argument O
is O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
knew O
or O
should O
have O
known O
of O
National O
Risk\u2019s O
financial O
condition O
and O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
knew O
or O
should O
have O
known O
that O
National O
Risk O
would O
receive O
the O
return O
premium O
from O
Midwestern O
and O
Lexington O
in O
the O
"course O
of O
performance O
of O
their O
obligations O
under O
the O
settlement O
agreement.\u201d O
The O
factual O
basis O
of O
Lexington\u2019s O
claim O
that O
Rose-Tillmann O
knew O
or O
should O
have O
known O
of O
the O
precarious O
financial O
condition O
of O
National O
Risk O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
Rose-Tillmann\u2019s O
president O
, O
William O
Holler O
, O
was O
a O
director O
of O
National O
Risk O
until O
March O
1991 O
, O
and O
was O
a O
shareholder O
and O
substantial O
investor O
in O
National O
Risk O
after O
that. O
Our O
brief O
answer O
to O
Lexington\u2019s O
argument O
is O
that O
National O
Risk O
was O
not O
an O
agent O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
or O
Rose-Tillmann O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
return O
of O
the O
premium O
. O
Implicit O
in O
Lexington\u2019s O
argument O
is O
the O
supposition O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
would O
have O
been O
under O
some O
obligation O
to O
move O
against O
National O
Risk O
for O
the O
return O
of O
the O
premium O
if O
the O
plaintiff O
knew O
of O
National O
Risk\u2019s O
precarious O
financial O
position. O
Lexington O
cites O
no O
authority O
in O
support O
of O
its O
argument O
, O
and O
we O
are O
confident O
none O
exists. O
We O
are O
confident O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
if O
made O
aware O
of O
National O
Risk\u2019s O
possible O
insolvency O
, O
would O
not O
have O
done O
anything O
differently. O
It O
would O
have O
assumed O
that O
under O
the O
agreement O
Lexington O
was O
obliged O
to O
pay; O
and O
it O
would O
have O
proceeded O
accordingly O
. O
For O
these O
reasons O
, O
the O
judgment O
in O
favor O
of O
Rose-Tillmann O
is O
affirmed O
. O

JUSTICE B-A
McCULLOUGH I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Plaintiff O
Pikeland O
Community O
Unit O
School O
District O
No. O
124 O
(Pike-land) O
filed O
suit O
seeking O
a O
declaration O
of O
coverage O
and O
a O
monetary O
*977award O
for O
losses O
suffered O
from O
asbestos-related O
property O
damage. O
The O
losses O
occurred O
over O
a O
period O
of O
years O
, O
from O
1975 O
to O
1990. O
Five O
insurance O
companies O
(Insurers) O
provided O
property O
damage O
coverage O
at O
different O
times O
during O
that O
period: O
Indiana O
Insurance O
Company O
(Indiana) O
, O
Country O
Mutual O
Insurance O
Company O
(Country O
Mutual) O
, O
Millers O
Mutual O
Insurance O
Company O
, O
Royal O
Globe O
Insurance O
Company O
, O
and O
Employers O
Insurance O
of O
Wausau. O
The O
insurance O
policies O
provided O
nearly O
identical O
time O
limitation O
provisions. O
(Millers O
Mutual O
and O
Royal O
Globe O
dispute O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
policies O
allegedly O
issued O
by O
them O
, O
but O
the O
parties O
stipulated O
that O
, O
if O
the O
policies O
exist O
, O
they O
contain O
terms O
and O
provisions O
as O
discussed O
herein.) O
They O
required O
Pikeland O
to O
provide O
immediate O
written O
notice O
of O
any O
loss O
, O
submission O
of O
a O
sworn O
proof O
of O
loss O
within O
60 O
days O
after O
the O
loss O
, O
and O
commencement O
of O
any O
action O
to O
recover O
under O
the O
policies O
within O
one O
year O
(Indiana\u2019s O
policy O
allowed O
two O
years) O
of O
loss. O
Pikeland O
filed O
notices O
and O
proofs O
of O
loss O
with O
the O
insurance O
companies. O
It O
is O
undisputed O
that O
the O
filings O
were O
not O
timely O
made O
pursuant O
to O
the O
contractual O
requirements O
, O
and O
the O
filings O
were O
made O
up O
to O
18 O
years O
after O
the O
relevant O
deadline O
in O
the O
contract. O
The O
Insurers O
refused O
coverage O
for O
the O
claims O
, O
and O
Pikeland O
filed O
this O
suit. O
The O
initiation O
of O
the O
suit O
does O
not O
comply O
with O
the O
relevant O
time O
requirements O
in O
the O
insurance O
contracts. O
The O
Insurers O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
on O
the O
grounds O
of O
untimely O
notice O
and O
suit O
initiation. O
Pikeland O
responded O
that O
it O
was O
entitled O
to O
immunity O
from O
the O
limitations O
periods O
under O
the O
doctrine O
of O
nullum O
tempus. O
In O
addition O
, O
Pikeland O
argued O
that O
the O
addition O
of O
an O
endorsement O
to O
Country O
Mutual\u2019s O
policy O
cancelled O
the O
relevant O
notice O
and O
suit O
limitation O
provisions. O
The O
trial O
court O
held O
that O
the O
doctrine O
of O
nullum O
tempus O
did O
not O
apply O
to O
the O
contractual O
limitations O
period O
and O
the O
endorsement O
to O
Country O
Mutual\u2019s O
policies O
incorporated O
the O
relevant O
limitations O
provisions. O
Pikeland O
now O

the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
holdings O
were O

and O
the O
order O

for O

The O
issue O
on O

that O

I O

under O

Under O
what O

does O
the O

have O
in O

that O
would O
permit O
the O

the O
right O
to O
carry O
a O

would O
otherwise O
be O

interpretation O
of O
the O
limitations O
of O
the O
unlawful O
use O
of O
statute O
24 O
\u2014 O
1 O
. O
My O
interpretation O
of O
the O
statute O
at O
the O
time O
was O
that O
Subsection O
6 O
creates O
an O
exemption O
for O
persons O
employed O
as O
a O
security O
guard O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
persons O
and O
private O
property O
while O
actually O
engaged O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
his O
or O
her O
duty. O
And O
I O
interpreted O
the O
word O
duty O
to O
mean O
for O
the O
protection O
of O
persons O
and O
private O
property O
relating O
to O
the O
commercial O
operation.\u201d O
However O
, O
neither O
section O
24 O
\u2014 O
2(a)(6) O
of O
the O
Code O
nor O
Johnson O
indicates O
that O
, O
for O
the O
exemption O
to O
apply O
, O
defendant O
must O
be O
protecting O
persons O
or O
property O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
arrest. O
As O
in O
Johnson O
, O
defendant O
in O
the O
present O
case O
was O
in O
the O
course O
of O
his O
employment O
performing O
duties O
requested O
of O
him O
by O
his O
employer. O
As O
in O
Johnson O
, O
*1000nowhere O
in O
the O
record O
is O
there O
evidence O
that O
he O
was O
on O
a O
private O
jaunt O
unrelated O
to O
his O
employment. O
Although O
the O
legislature O
could O
have O
drafted O
the O
exemption O
to O
include O
only O
those O
who O
were O
performing O
the O
specific O
duty O
of O
protecting O
persons O
or O
property O
, O
section O
24\u2014 O
2(a)(6) O
of O
the O
Code O
contains O
no O
such O
limitation. O
"While O
the O
judiciary O
has O
the O
authority O
to O
read O
language O
into O
a O
statute O
which O
has O
been O
omitted O

this O

be O

in O
holding O
that O

claim O
against O

for O
injuries O
sustained O
on O
December O

employed O

as O
a O
"journeyman\u201d O
sheet O
metal O
worker. O
In O
awarding O
claimant O
benefits O
, O
the O
arbitrator O
combined O
wages O
from O
both O
jobs O
to O
reflect O
an O
average O
weekly O
wage O
of O
$619.74. O
The O
Industrial O
Commission O

affirmed. O
The O
circuit O
court O
of O
Whiteside O

reversed O
, O
finding O
that O
claimant O
was O
not O
concurrently O
employed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
injury O
and O
therefore O
his O
benefits O
were O
to O
be O
based O
only O
on O
an O
average O
weekly O
wage O
of O
$141 O
from O
his O
job O
at O
Village O
Apartments. O
We O
reverse O
. O
At O
the O
arbitration O
hearing O
, O
claimant O
stated O
that O
he O
lived O
in O
Erie O
and O
worked O
for O
Village O
Apartments O
as O
a O
maintenance O
man. O
Claimant O
injured O
his O
hand O
on O
December O
3 O
, O
1990 O
, O
while O
operating O
a O
snow O
blower O
for O
Village O
Apartments. O
Claimant O
sustained O
severe O
lacerations O
which O
eventually O
required O
amputation O
of O
the O
distal O
aspect O
of O
the O
second O
and O
third O
fingers O
of O
his O
left O
hand. O
A O
subsequent O
infection O
in O
his O
hand O
necessitated O
a O
second O
amputation O
to O
the O
PIP O
joint O
of O
his O
third O
finger O
in O
August O
1991 O
. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
was O
also O
employed O
as O
a O
union O
or O
"journeyman\u201d O
sheet O
metal O
worker. O
Claimant O
said O
he O
worked O
as O
a O
sheet O
metal O
worker O
throughout O
most O
of O
the O
year O
preceding O
his O
injury O
and O
earned O
$24 O
, O
894.85. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
had O
been O
laid O
off O
from O
his O
sheet O
metal O
work O
for O
two O
or O
three O
weeks O
when O
the O
accident O
occurred O
in O
December O
1990. O
Claimant O
said O
that O
it O
was O
not O
unusual O
for O
sheet O
metal O
workers O
to O
be O
laid O
off O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
in O
between O
jobs O
*446and O
that O
he O
was O
at O
all O
times O
subject O
to O
recall. O
He O
stated O
that O
he O
had O
been O
a O
member O
of O
the O
sheet O
metal O
workers\u2019 O
union O
since O
1979 O
and O
his O
dues O
were O
paid O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
injury. O
Claimant O
said O
he O
was O
always O
on O
the O
union O
hall O
list O
to O
be O
called O
for O
sheet O
metal O
jobs O
if O
he O
was O
not O
currently O
working. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
it O
was O
customary O
to O
finish O
one O
sheet O
metal O
job O
and O
then O
go O
on O
to O
another O
sheet O
metal O
assignment. O
However O
, O
he O
admitted O
that O
if O
no O
sheet O
metal O
jobs O
were O
available O
, O
such O
workers O
would O
have O
to O
go O
on O
unemployment O
. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
worked O
at O
Village O
Apartments O
whether O
he O
was O
working O
or O
laid O
off O
from O
his O
sheet O
metal O
jobs. O
The O
record O
is O
undisputed O
that O
Village O
Apartments O
knew O
that O
claimant O
was O
employed O
as O
a O
sheet O
metal O
worker. O
Claimant O
testified O
that O
he O
was O
called O
to O
work O
immediately O
after O
he O
was O
released O
to O
work O
on O
July O
16 O
, O
1991 O
, O
but O
he O
experienced O
difficulty O
in O
performing O
his O
job O
and O
his O
fingers O
became O
infected O
again. O
Claimant O
had O
to O
turn O
down O
another O
sheet O
metal O
work O
call O
on O
August O
14 O
, O
1991 O
, O
since O
he O
had O
just O
had O
his O
second O
amputation O
surgery O
on O
August O
13 O
, O
1991 O
. O
The O
arbitrator O
found O
that O
claimant O
was O
concurrently O
employed O
by O
Village O
Apartments O
and O
as O
a O
sheet O
metal O
worker O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
injury. O
Accordingly O
, O
the O
arbitrator O
combined O
claimant\u2019s O
wages O
from O
both O
jobs O
and O
computed O
an O
average O
weekly O
wage O
of O
$619.74. O
The O
arbitrator O
awarded O
$413.16 O
for O
40*/? O
weeks O
temporary O
total O
disability O
, O
$93.15 O
for O
reasonable O
and O
necessary O
medical O
expenses O
, O
and O
$340.37 O
for O
76 O
weeks O
for O
permanent O
and O
complete O
loss O
of O
claimant\u2019s O
left O
hand O
to O
the O
extent O
of O
40% O
thereof. O
The O
Commission O
affirmed O
this O
decision. O
The O
trial O
court O
reversed O
, O
finding O
that O
claimant O
was O
not O
concurrently O
employed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
injury O
and O
that O
his O
benefits O
should O
be O
based O
on O
an O
average O
weekly O
wage O
of O
$141 O
from O
his O
work O
at O
Village O
Apartments O
. O
Claimant\u2019s O
sole O
argument O
on O
appeal O
is O
that O
he O
was O
concurrently O
employed O
on O
the O
date O
of O
his O
injury O
pursuant O
to O
section O
10 O
of O

Compensation O
Act O
(Act) O
, O
which O
provides O
in O

the O

our O

determines O
the O

We O
conclude O

claimant O
in O

case O
has O
fully O
complied O
with O
all O
the O
provisions O
of O
section O

that O

an O

of O
the O

record O

even O
when O
he O

Although O
sheet O

workers O
are O
subject O
to O

we O
believe O
that O

not O

was O
a O
member O
in O
good O
standing O
of O
the O
union O
and O
the O
record O
is O
undisputed O
that O
he O
worked O
most O
of O
the O
52 O
weeks O
before O
his O
injury. O
Claimant O
returned O
to O
work O
as O
a O
sheet O
metal O
worker O
as O
soon O
as O
he O
was O
released O
to O
work O
after O
his O
injury. O
Claimant O
also O
stated O
that O
he O
was O
called O
back O
to O
work O
for O
a O
sheet O
metal O
job O
after O
the O
accident O
and O
that O
he O
had O
to O
turn O
it O
down O
because O
of O
his O
injury O
. O
Respondent O
argues O
that O
claimant O
was O
not O
employed O
as O
a O
sheet O
metal O
worker O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
injury O
and O
that O
claimant O
desires O
to O
get O
"as O
much O
money O
as O
possible O
without O
regard O
to O
the O
consequences O
that O
visit O
an O
employer O
, O
such O
as O
increased O
insurance O
premiums O
, O
inability O
to O
determine O
risks O
and O
costs O
, O
and O
a O
disinclination O
to O
hire O
laid O
off O
workers.\u201d O
In O
his O
treatise O
on O
worker\u2019s O
compensation O
laws O
, O
Professor O
Larson O
discusses O
the O
different O
doctrines O
employed O
by O
the O
States O
on O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
to O
combine O
earnings O
when O
an O
employee O
is O
concurrently O
employed O
at O
the O
time O
of O
injury. O
Professor O
Larson O
notes: O
"[F]airness O
to O
the O
employee O
and O
fairness O
to O
the O
employer-carrier O
are O
not O
symmetrical O
, O
and O
cannot O
be O
judged O
by O
the O
same O
standards. O
To O
this O
one O
employee O
, O
this O
one O
loss O
is O
everything O
\u2014 O
he O
has O
nothing O
against O
which O
to O
offset O
it. O
To O
the O
employer O
, O
and O
even O
more O
to O
the O
carrier O
, O
this O
is O
just O
one O
case O
among O
many. O
The O
rule O
operates O
impartially O
in O
both O
directions. O
Today O
this O
employer-carrier O
may O
be O
saddled O
with O
a O
slight O
extra O
cost; O
tomorrow O
the O
positions O
may O
be O
*448reversed O
, O
and O
the O
employer-carrier O
will O
be O
completely O
relieved O
of O
the O
cost O
of O
an O
injury O
to O
one O
of O
its O
employees O
in O
a O
concurrent-employment O
situation O
, O
when O
it O
happens O
to O
he O
the O
other O
employment O
in O
which O
the O
injury O
occurs. O
This O
is O
the O
essence O
of O
the O
concept O
of O
spreading O
the O
risk O
in O
a O
system O
like O
workmen\u2019s O
compensation O
. O
For O
the O
injured O
workman O
, O
*** O
[h]e O

he O

the O
burden O

being O
reduced O
to O
$20 O
a O
week O
when O
his O
actual O
earnings O
may O
have O
been O
five O
times O
that O
much. O
That O
is O
real O
unfairness. O
By O

the O
'unfairness\u2019 O

in O
the O
form O
perhaps O
of O

by O
the O

the O

Section O

provides O
for O
the O

to O
order O

that O

Applying O
this O
analysis O
to O
the O
present O
case O
, O
we O
note O
that O
Real O
Management O
, O
Inc. O
, O
purchased O
delinquent O
taxes O
for O
the O
property O
in O
question O
during O
the O
2003 O
scavenger O
tax O
sale O
and O
assigned O
the O
certif\u00edcate O
of O
purchase O
to O
the O
petitioner. O
About O
two O
years O
later O
, O
during O
the O
2005 O
scavenger O
tax O
sale O
, O
a O
third O
tax O
buyer O
, O
Sahli O

, O

, O
purchased O
the O
1987 O

taxes O
(exclusive O
of O
the O
1996 O
, O
1997 O
, O
2000 O
, O
and O
2001 O
taxes). O
In O
August O

petitioner O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O

the O

sold O
to O
Sahli O

The O

court O
granted O
petitioner\u2019s O
motion. O
The O
trial O
court\u2019s O
ruling O
was O
in O
error; O
since O
the O
2005 O
scavenger O
tax O
sale O
was O
subsequent O
to O
petitioner\u2019s O
sale O
in O
2003 O
, O
petitioner O
was O
required O
under O
section O
22\u2014 O
40(a) O
to O
redeem O
the O
2005 O
sale O
in O
order O
for O
the O

See O

and O

which O
occur O
subsequent O
to O
the O

been O
redeemed\u201d) O
. O
Petitioner O
argues O
that O
the O
2005 O
sale O
included O
taxes O
for O
years O
prior O
to O
his O
sale O
in O
2003 O
, O
and O
as O
such O
, O
that O
he O
should O
not O
be O
required O
to O
redeem O
those O
taxes. O
Petitioner\u2019s O
argument O
is O
without O
merit O
, O
as O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40(a) O
expressly O
states O
that O
\u201call\u201d O
subsequent O
sales O

be O
redeemed O
(35 O
ILCS O
200/22 O
\u2014 O

and O
makes O
no O
exception O
for O
subsequent O
sales O
incorporating O
prior O
years\u2019 O
taxes O
. O
Petitioner O
also O
argues O
that O
the O
prior O
taxes O
sold O
at O
the O
2005 O
scavenger O
tax O
sale O
were O
delinquent O
at O
the O
time O
of O
petitioner\u2019s O
sale O
in O
2003 O
, O
and O
that O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40(b) O
required O
the O

to O
\u201cfind O
that O
the O

of O
those O

has O
been O

title.\u201d O

ILCS O
200/22 O
\u2014 O
40(b) O
(West O

Petitioner\u2019s O
argument O
is O
without O
merit; O
as O
discussed O
above O
, O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40(b) O
has O
no O
effect O
until O
the O

, O
i.e. O
, O
until O

the O
*403petitioner O

all O

, O
including O
in O
the O
present O

the O

Petitioner O
contends O
that O
our O

of O

improperly O
renders O
section O

\u2014 O

of O
the O
Property O

superfluous. O
Section O
21 O
\u2014 O

provides O
for O
a O
sale O
in O

when: O
\u201cthe O

that O

that O

Petitioner O
argues O
that O

\u2014 O
40 O
\u201crenders O
the O

in O
[sjection O

\u2014 O

superfluous O
and O
futile O
as O
no O

could O
be O
held O
in O
error O
by O
way O
of O
a O

order.\u201d O
Petitioner\u2019s O
contention O
is O
without O
merit. O
Under O
our O
construction O
of O
the O
statute O
, O
the O
merger O
provisions O
of O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40(b) O
do O
not O
become O
operative O
until O
petitioner O
first O
complies O
with O
all O
the O
requirements O
of O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40(a) O
and O
obtains O
the O
tax O
deed. O
However O
, O
once O
the O
petitioner O
complies O
with O
the O
requirements O
of O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40(a) O
, O
and O
the O
tax O

, O
taxes O
from O

that O

be O
merged O
under O

The O
sale O
in O

provision O
of O
section O
21 O
\u2014 O

is O
not O
superfluous O
. O
Finally O
, O
petitioner O
contends O
that O
our O
construction O
of O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40 O
violates O
section O
22 O
\u2014 O
55 O
of O
the O
Property O
Tax O
Code O
, O
which O
states O
, O
\u201cThis O
Section O
shall O
be O
liberally O
construed O
so O
that O
tax O
deeds O
shall O
convey O
merchantable O
title.\u201d O
35 O
ILCS O
200/22 O
\u2014 O

(West O

Petitioner O
contends O
that O
if O
\u201ca O
tax O
deed O
is O
subject O
to O
unpaid O
prior O
taxes O
, O
which O
were O
not O
a O
part O
of O
the O
tax O
sale O
in O
the O
first O
instance O
, O
then O
the O
tax O
deed O
does O
not O
convey O
merchantable O
title.\u201d O
However O
, O
as O
aptly O
noted O
by O
the O
respondent: O
\u201cThis O
simply O
will O
not O
be O
true O
if O
the O
tax O
deed O
holder O
properly O
avails O
himself O
of O
the O
protections O
contained O
in O
Section O
22 O
\u2014 O
40 O
as O
it O
was O
intended. O
First O
, O
that O
tax O
buyer O
would O
not O
be O
entitled O
to O
a O
tax O
deed O
unless O
it O
had O
redeemed O
all O
forfeitures O
and O
subsequent O
tax O
sales O
, O
notwithstanding O
whether O
the O
tax O
years O
in O
the O
subsequent O
sale O
were O
for O
prior O
or O
subsequent O
years. O
Next O
, O
the O
deed O
would O
convey O
merchantable O
title O
so O
long O
as O
the O
tax O
buyer O
, O
once O
it O
obtained O
a O
tax O
deed O
, O
took O
the O
time O
to O
seek O
a O
merger O
of O
any O
taxes O
which O
were O
unsold O
and O
open O
upon O
the O
expiration O
of O
certificate O
of O
purchase O
or O
upon O
the O
granting O
of O
a O
sale O
in O
error. O
By O
doing O
so O
, O
there O
would O
be O
no O
outstanding O
taxes O
which O
could O
interfere O
with O
clear O
title. O
Thus O
, O
Section O

*40440 O
, O
when O
properly O
and O
fully O
complied O
with O
, O
actually O
ensures O
merchantable O
title O
is O
conveyed O
to O
the O
tax O
buyer.\u201d O
For O
the O
foregoing O
reasons O
, O
the O
petitioner O
must O
redeem O
the O

On O

this O

determined O
that O

the O

it O
denied O

We O

2008 O
, O
the O
court O
set O
a O
briefing O
schedule O
on O
defendant\u2019s O
motion O

Plaintiff O
subsequently O
moved O

and O
for O
sanctions O
pursuant O
to O
Supreme O
Court O
Rule O

(155 O

in O

to O
her O
response O
to O
the O
motion O
to O
strike O
, O
a O
countermotion O
for O

. O
A O
hearing O
on O
all O
motions O
was O
scheduled O
for O
October O
21 O
, O
2008. O
Before O
the O

, O
the O
court O
reviewed O
\u201cthe O
court O
file O
and O
the O
motions O
, O
briefs O
, O
responses O
, O
and O
replies\u201d O
that O
the O
parties O
had O
filed. O
At O
the O
hearing O
, O
no O
evidence O
was O
presented; O
rather O
, O
the O
attorneys O
argued O
the O
points O
raised O
in O
their O
motions O
and O

. O
The O
court O
noted O
in O
the O
certified O
report O
of O

that O

, O
nor O
in O
any O
of O
the O

did O
defendant\u2019s O
attorney O
claim O
that O
the O
defendant O
was O
not O
served O
, O
or O
that O
she O
had O
any O
valid O
reason O
for O
ignoring O
the O
three O

from O

, O
] O
until O

Additionally O
, O
the O
court O
noted O
that O
the O
attachments O
to O
plaintiff\u2019s O
motion O
to O
strike O
and O
for O
sanctions O
demonstrated O
that O
defendant\u2019s O
insurance O
carrier O
was O
aware O
of O
the O
pending O
litigation O
prior O
to O
both O
the O
entry O
of O
the O
default O
(on O
July O
23 O
, O
2008) O
and O
the O
entry O
of O
the O
default O
judgment O
(on O
August O
6 O
, O
2008). O
According O
to O
the O
court O
, O
a O
July O

, O
2008 O
, O
letter O
from O
defendant\u2019s O
insurance O

to O
plaintiff\u2019s O
counsel O
noted: O
\u201cI O

A O

of O
the O

indicates O
that O
there O
[sic] O
service O
has O
been O
obtained O
on O
our O
insured O
to O

The O
certified O
report O
of O
proceedings O
concludes O
that O
, O
on O
October O
21 O
, O
2008 O
, O
defendant\u2019s O
motion O
to O
vacate O
the O
default O
judgment O
was O
denied O
because O
the O
court O
did O
not O
find O
\u201cany O
good O
cause O
shown O
for O
defendant\u2019s O
failure O
to O
take O
any O
action O
for O
nearly O
two O
months O
after O
being O
served O
and O
that O
vacating O
the O
default O
judgment O
would O
not O
be O
fair O
to O
the O
plaintiff.\u201d O

II. O
ANALYSIS O
Defendant O
argues O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
abused O
its O
discretion O
by O
denying O
her O
section O
2 O
\u2014 O
1301(e) O
motion O
to O
vacate O
the O
default O
judgment. O
She O
argues O
that O
section O
2 O
\u2014 O
1301 O
allows O
a O
default O
judgment O
to O
be O
vacated O
when O
substantial O
justice O
so O
warrants. O
Here O
, O
defendant O
argues O
, O
substantial O
justice O
was O
not O
served O
because: O
(1) O
the O
penalty O
against O
her O
*715is O
severe; O
(2) O
forcing O
plaintiff O
to O
proceed O
to O
trial O
would O
not O
result O
in O
attendant O
hardship; O
and O
(3) O
during O
the O
approximately O
40 O
days O
between O
the O
original O
return O
date O
on O
the O
summons O
and O
defendant\u2019s O
filing O
of O
her O
motion O
to O
vacate O
, O
her O
insurance O
carrier O
was O
trying O
to O
settle O
the O
claim O
and O
had O
requested O
documentation O
of O
plaintiffs O
bills. O
Defendant O
argues O
that O
she O
\u201cshould O
not O
be O
punished O
for O
attempting O
to O
settle O
the O
matter O
, O
\u201d O
and O
she O
notes O
that O
, O
on O
August O
6 O
, O
2008 O
, O
the O
same O
day O
as O
the O
default O
judgment O
, O
plaintiffs O
counsel O
sent O
defendant\u2019s O
insurance O
carrier O
a O
letter O
inviting O
the O
carrier O
to O
present O
a O
counteroffer O
. O
The O
parties O
debate O
whether O
section O
2 O
\u2014 O
1301(e) O
(setting O
aside O
of O
default O
judgments) O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
section O
2 O
\u2014 O
1203 O
of O
the O
Code O
(735 O
ILCS O
5/2 O
\u2014 O
1203 O
(West O
2006)) O
(motions O
after O
judgment O
in O
nonjury O
cases) O
, O
was O
the O
proper O
avenue O
for O
defendant\u2019s O
motion O
to O
vacate. O
As O
mentioned O
in O
our O
prior O
ruling O
in O
this O
case O
, O
for O
purposes O
of O
our O
review O
, O
the O
section O
of O
the O
Code O
under O
which O
defendant O
filed O
her O
motion O
is O
irrelevant O
because O
, O
under O
either O
section O
, O
we O
review O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
decision O
for O
an O
abuse O
of O
discretion. O

We O
may O
find O
an O
abuse O
of O
discretion O
only O
where O
the O
trial O
court O
acted O
arbitrarily O
such O
that O
no O
reasonable O

would O
take O

adopted. O

Here O
, O
defendant O
asserts O
that O

\u201cWhether O
substantial O
justice O
is O
being O
achieved O
by O
vacating O
a O
judgment O
or O
order O
is O
not O
subject O
to O
precise O
definition O
, O
but O
relevant O
considerations O
include O
diligence O
or O
the O
lack O
thereof O
, O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
meritorious O
defense O
, O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
penalty O
resulting O
from O
the O
order O
or O
judgment O
, O
and O
the O
relative O
hardships O
on O
the O
parties O
from O
granting O
or O
denying O
vacatur.\u201d O
Jackson O
, O
384 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O

We O
cannot O
conclude O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
here O
abused O
its O
discretion O
in O
determining O
that O
substantial O
justice O
did O
not O
require O
the O
default O
judgment O
to O
be O
vacated O
. O
Defendant O
argues O
generally O
that O
it O
is O
unjust O
to O
enter O
judgment O
against O
a O
party O
without O
a O
trial O
on O
the O
merits. O
However O
, O
in O
light O
of O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case O
, O
we O
cannot O
conclude O
on O
this O
basis O
alone O
that O
substantial O
justice O
was O
not O
served O
and O
that O
no O
reasonable O
person O
would O
take O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
position. O
According O
to O
the O
certified O
report O
of O
proceedings O
, O
defendant O
was O
properly O
served O
and O
failed O
to O
appear O
before O
the O
court O
on O
at O
least O
three O
occasions: O
on O
the O
summons\u2019 O
original O
return O
*716date O
, O
on O
the O
continued O
return O
date O
, O
and O
at O
the O
proveup O
hearing. O
As O
the O
trial O
court O
noted O
, O
neither O
below O
nor O
on O
appeal O
does O
defendant O
argue O
that O
she O
was O
not O
served O
, O
that O
she O
had O
good O
cause O
for O
not O
appearing O
, O
or O
that O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
that O
she O
needed O
to O
appear O
(although O
even O
a O
lack O
of O
notice O
of O
a O
hearing O
date O
would O
not O
necessarily O
excuse O
the O
failure O
to O
appear O
(Jackson O
, O
384 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
549)). O
Thus O
, O
the O
court O
did O
not O
abuse O
its O
discretion O
in O
considering O
defendant\u2019s O
failure O
to O
appear O
, O
particularly O
in O
light O
of O
her O
insurance O
company\u2019s O
awareness O
of O
the O
suit O
as O
early O
as O
July O
3 O
, O
2008 O
, O
and O
her O
assertion O
that O
she O
was O
attempting O
to O
settle O
the O
case O
, O
as O
reflecting O
a O
lack O
of O
diligence. O
Indeed O
, O
even O
on O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
does O
not O
explain O
why O
her O
(or O
plaintiff\u2019s O
counsel\u2019s) O
attempts O
to O
settle O
the O
matter O
(or O
, O
as O
alleged O
in O
her O
motion O
to O
vacate O
, O
her O
attorney\u2019s O
alleged O
lack O
of O
notice O
of O
the O
suit O
until O
August O
25 O
, O
2008) O
in O
any O
way O
excused O
her O
from O
personally O
appearing O
before O
the O
court. O
Defendant\u2019s O
argument O
that O
requiring O
plaintiff O
to O
proceed O
to O
trial O
would O
not O
result O
in O
hardship O
to O
her O
ignores O
that O
, O
in O
that O
case O
, O
plaintiff O
would O
necessarily O
incur O
additional O
litigation O
expenses. O
Therefore O
, O
we O
cannot O
conclude O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
abused O
its O
discretion O
in O
concluding O
that O
vacating O
the O
default O
judgment O
would O
be O
unfair O
to O
plaintiff O
who O
had O
, O
at O
that O
point O
, O
proved O
up O
her O
case O
and O
the O
resultant O
damages O
. O

he O
worked O
steadily. O
He O
paid O
about O
$15 O
per O
week O
for O
room O
and O
board O
, O
and O
testified O
that O
his O
son O
sent O
him O
no O
money O
at O
any O
time O
while O
he O
was O
at O
Wilmette O
. O
The O
evidence O
of O
contributions O
made O
by O
the O
deceased O
to O
defendant O
in O

is O
, O
that O
for O
some O
time O
prior O
to O
two O
years O
before O
the O
accident O
he O
had O
turned O
over O
$15 O
a O
week O
and O
paid O
gas O
bills O
at O
the O
home O
which O
the O
defendant O
in O

owned O
at O
Ottawa O
, O
Illinois O
, O
and O
in O
which O
defendant O
in O

was O
living O
during O
that O
year O
with O
his O
daughter O

her O
husband. O
This O
home O
is O
valued O
at O
$3500 O
, O
less O
a O

of O
$800. O
Defendant O
in O

testified O
that O
during O
this O
time O
he O
did O
not O
contribute O
to O
the O
up-keep O
of O
the O

the O
time O

it O
is O
evident O
from O
the O

that O
he O
paid O
little O
attention O
to O
what O

provides O
as O
hereinbefore O
set O
out O
in O

It O
will O
be O
noted O
that O

draws O
a O

Defendant O
in O
error O
urges O
that O
a O
parent O

lineal O

is O
presumed O
to O
be O
dependent O
, O
as O
in O
case O
of O
a O
plaintiff O
coming O
under O
the O
Injuries O
act. O
If O
this O
were O
the O
rule O
dependency O
would O
exist O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
law O
upon O
showing O
such O
relationship O
and O
no O
reason O
for O
the O
distinction O
made O
in O
the O
different O
paragraphs O
of O
section O
7 O
of O
the O
act O
would O
exist. O
This O
court O
has O
frequently O
held O
that O
the O
question O
of O
dependency O
, O
and O
the O
extent O
of O
it O
, O
are O
questions O
of O
fact; O
that O
a O
dependent O
is O
one O
who O
is O
sustained O
or O
relies O
for O
support O
on O
the O
aid O
of O
another O

From O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
in O
this O
case O
it O
is O
evident O
that O
he O
was O
not O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
death O
of O
the O
deceased O
dependent O
upon O
him O
for O
support. O
He O
was O
then O
employed O
at O
a O
regular O
wage O
several O
times O
that O
received O
by O
the O
deceased. O
They O
were O
living O
in O
different O
parts O
of O
the O
State O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
tending O
to O
establish O
that O
deceased O
was O
contributing O
to O
defendant O
in O
error\u2019s O
support. O
The O
contributions O
by O
the O
deceased O
testified O
to O
by O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
were O
two O
years O
previous O
to O
the O
death O
of O
the O
son O
, O
when O
the O
former O
was O
living O
with O
his O
daughter O
in O
a O
house O
owned O
by O
him O
in O
the O
city O
of O
Ottawa. O
The O
deceased O
came O
to O
the O
home O
for O
week-ends O
and O
while O
there O
would O
get O
his O
meals. O
Defendant O
in O
error O
testified O
that O
he O
(defendant O
in O
error) O
was O
away O
from O
home O
a O
considerable O
portion O
of O
the O
time; O
that O
while O
there O
he O
did O
not O
furnish O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
house O
for O
the O
family O
of O
his O
daughter O
and O
her O
husband O
but O
furnished O
the O
house. O
It O
seems O
clear O
from O
this O
record O
that O
he O
was O
not O
only O
able O
to O
support O
himself O
at O
the O
*122time O
of O
the O
death O
of O
his O
son O
but O
was O
doing O
so O
and O
was O
in O
no O
way O
relying O
upon O
the O
latter O
for O
support. O
Dependency O
is O
not O
shown O
by O
the O
record O
. O
The O

In O

Higgins O
had O
an O
acute O
attack O
of O
Bright\u2019s O
disease O
, O
lasting O
six O
weeks O
, O
which O
affected O
him O
to O
such O
an O
extent O
that O
he' O
never O
fully O
recovered O
, O
and O
thereafter O
he O
had O
relapses O
lasting O
several O
weeks O
at O
a O
time O
, O
and O
suffered O
from O
uremic O
poisoning O
, O
and O
during O
these O
times O
his O
mind O
was O
not O
so O
quick O
as O
usual O
nor O
his O
memory O
so O
good. O
His O
blood O
pressure O
was O
high O
, O
and O
in O
April O
, O
1917 O
, O
he O
had O
acute O
bronchitis O
, O
and O
in O
May O
, O
dropsy. O
His O
physician O
told O
him O
he O
was O
not O
fit O
for O
business O
and O
advised O
him O
to O
give O
it O
up. O
He O
grew O
worse O
, O
and O
in O
November O
became O
much O
worse O
, O
was O
delirious O
, O
and O
his O
physicians O
thought O
it O
necessary O
to O
bleed O
him O
, O
and O
did O
take O
500 O
cubic O
centimeters O
of O
blood O
from O
him. O
Afterward O
he O
got O
up O
and O
against O
his O
doctor\u2019s O
orders O
went O
out O
during O
the O
months O
of O
December O
and O
January. O
On O

ninth O
and O
tenth O
, O
he O
grew O
worse O
, O
and O
died O
on O
February O

Dr. O
Bachelle O
testified O
that O
in O
November O
, O
1917 O
, O
and O
February O
, O
1918 O
, O
at O
the O
time O
when O
Higgins O
was O
bled O
, O
he O
failed O
to O
recognize O
Dr. O
Steffin O
, O
who O
was O
associated O
with O
Bachelle O
, O
but O
at O
those O
times O
Higgins O
was O
unconscious. O
This O
witness O
also O
testified O
that O
he O
had O
known O
Higgins O
many O
years O
and O
knew O
his O
normal O
mental O
state; O
that O
during O
the O
winter O
of O
1917 O
and O
1918 O
he O
was O
not O
in O
a O
normal O
state O
mentally; O
that O
he O
was O
irresponsible O
, O
not O
in O
a O
state O
to O
decide O
for O
himself O
or O
in O
a O
mental O
condition O
to O
transact O
business O
and O
should O
not O
have O
been O
allowed O
to O
go O
out. O
By O
\u201cirresponsible\u201d O
the O
doctor O
said O
he O
meant O
deranged O
mentally O
, O
but O
he O
did O
not O
give O
any O
instances O
of O
mental O
incompetency O
except O
the O
inability O
to O
recognize O
Dr. O
Steffin O
, O
when O
Higgins O
was O
unconscious. O
Dr. O
Steffin O
also O
expressed O
an O
opinion O
of O
the O
incompetency O
of O
Higgins O
from O
observation O
of O
him O
on O
the O
two O
occasions O
when O
he O
was O
bled O
and O
was O
unable O
to O
recognize O
Dr. O
Steffin. O
Mrs. O
Conlin.and O
Mrs.'Van O
Thompson O
were O
friends O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
of O
long O
standing O
and O
were O
frequent O
visitors O
at O
their O
house. O
They O
testified O
as O
to O
the O
condition O
of O
Higgins\u2019 O
health O
and O
the O
course O
of O
his O
sickness O
, O
to O
certain O
peculiarities O
and O
eccentricities O
in O
his O
conduct O
and O
changes O
in O
his O
manner O
, O
and O
expressed O
rather O
vaguely O
their O
opinion O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
transact O
business O
, O
but O
did O
not O
express O
an O
opinion O
that O
he O
was O
of O
unsound O
mind O
or O
state O
facts O
upon O
which O
such O
an O
opinion O
could O
properly O
rest. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
there O
was O
the O
testimony O
of O
several O
witnesses O
, O
acquaintances O
of O
Higgins O
who O
had O
known O
him O
for O
years O
and O
associated O
with O
him O
at O
the O
Board O
of O
Trade O
, O
who O
saw O
and O
conversed O
with O
him O
in O
January O
before O
his O
death O
and O
observed O
no O
indication O
of O
any O
lack O
of O
mental O
capacity O
. O
The O
deed O
was O
executed O
on O
January O
5 O
, O
1918 O
, O
and O
the O
circumstances O
attending O
its O
execution O
were O
related O
by O
the O
complainant O
and O
by O
Duane O
T. O
McNabb O
, O
who O
prepared O
it O
and O
as O
a O
notary O
public O
took O
the O
acknowledgment O
of O
the O
grantors. O
The O
complainant O
testified O
that O
on O
that O
day O
she O
went O
with O
*16her O
husband O
to O
the O
offices O
of O
the O
attorneys O
of O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
, O
in O
the O
First O
National O
Bank O
building O
, O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
signing O
the O
deed; O
that O
she O
went O
with O
her O
husband O
into O
a O
room O
where O
several O
men O
were O
, O
and O
he O
sat O
down O
at O
a O
desk O
and O
had O
some O
conversation O
which O
she O
did O
not O
hear; O
that O
her O
husband O
then O
signed O
the O
deed O
and O
asked O
her O
to O
sign O
it O
, O
and O
she O
did O
so. O
She O
had O
never O
been O
to O
those O
offices O
before O
, O
had O
never O
talked O
to O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
or O
anyone O
else O
about O
signing O
the O
deed O
, O
but O
went O
there O
to O
sign O
it O
and O
signed O
it O
without O
question O
solely O
because O
her O
husband O
asked O
her O
to. O
She O
said O
that O
he O
never O
said O
a O
word O
to O
her O
as O
to O
why O
he O
wanted O
her O
to O
sign O
the O
deed O
and O
she O
never O
asked O
him O
a O
word; O
that O
she O
never O
mentioned O
it O
afterward O
and O
he O
never O
did O
. O
McNabb O
testified O
that O
he O
had O
prepared O
the O
deed O
and O
was O
present O
when O
it O
was O
executed O
and O
at O
the O
conference O
preceding O
its O
execution. O
F. O
C. O
Hack O
, O
of O
the O
firm O
of O
attorneys O
, O
was O
present O
and O
had O
the O
notes O
and O
mortgages O
given O
to O
Arthur O
S. O
Jackson. O
McNabb O
, O
Hack O
and O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
were O
the O
only O
persons O
present. O
McNabb O
said O
to O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
that O
it O
was O
his O
understanding O
the O
notes O
and O
mortgages O
were O
to O
be O
canceled O
and O
returned O
to O
them O
, O
and O
asked O
if O
that O
was O
correct. O
Higgins O
said O
it O
was O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
nodded O
her O
head. O
Hack O
also O
explained O
to O
them O
that O
inasmuch O
as O
the O
mortgages O
had O
not O
been O
recorded O
he O
wanted O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
they O
understood O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
transaction O
, O
and O
that O
the O
title O
to O
the O
Chicago O
Title O
and O
Trust O
Company O
was O
for O
Jackson\u2019s O
benefit O
and O
not O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
another O
mortgage. O
Higgins O
said O
he O
so. O
understood O
it O
and O
it O
was O
immaterial O
to O
whom O
they O
made O
the O
deed. O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
said O
she O
understood O
it O
the O
same O
way. O
The O
notes O
and O
mortgages O
were O
then O
marked O
\u201cpaid O
and O
canceled\u201d O
and O
delivered O
to O
Higgins. O
McNabb. O
saw O
both O
the O
complainant O
and O
her O
husband O
sign O
the O
deed O
and O
then O
took O
their O
acknowledgment. O
He O
asked O
, O
each O
of O
them O
if O
they O
executed O
the O
instrument O
as O
their O
free O
and O
voluntary O
act O
, O
and O
both O
said O
they O
did O
. O
*17The O
complainant O
was O
in O
constant O
attendance O
upon O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
the O
draft O
upon O
her O
physical O
and O
mental O
resources O
, O
particularly O
after O
his O
serious O
sickness O
in O
November O
, O
was O
continuous O
and O
severe. O
She O
was O
worried O
about O
his O
condition O
and O
her O
nerves O
were O
over-wrought O
but O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
of O
mental O
unsoundness. O
Her O
mind O
was O
clear O
enough O
, O
so O
far O
as O
appears O
from O
the O
evidence O
, O
but O
her O
whole O
thought O
was O
devoted O
to O
the O
care O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
whose O
condition O
of O
health O
was O
critical O
but O
who O
still O
insisted O
on O
going O
out O
and O
attending O
to O
business. O
She O
was O
not O
giving O
any O
thought O
to O
business O
and O
did O
not O
concern O
herself O
with O
it O
, O
but O
she O
consented O
to O
go O
down-town O
to O
sign O
the O
deed O
when O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
, O
and O
signed O
it O
without O
objection O
or O
question O
and O
without O
any O
reason O
to O
do O
so O
except O
that O
he O
requested O
it. O
The O
evidence O
does O
not O
justify O
the O
conclusion O
that O
either O
the O
complainant O
or O
her O
husband O
did O
not O
have O
the O
mental O
capacity O
to O
execute O
the O
deed O
or O
did O
not O
know O
and O
understand O
the O
effect O
of O
what O
they O
were O
doing. O
It O
is O
apparent O
that O
Higgins\u2019 O
health O
was O
in O
a O
serious O
condition O
for O
many O
months O
before O
his O
death O
and O
that O
he O
made O
no O
substantial O
improvement O
after O
November O
, O
1917. O
It O
was O
very O
imprudent O
for O
him O
to O
go O
out O
in O
December O
and O
January O
afterward O
, O
contrary O
to O
his O
physician\u2019s O
advice O
, O
and O
engage O
in O
business O
, O
but O
he O
did O
so O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
the O
business O
was O
not O
"prudently O
transacted O
or O
that O
he O
did O
not O
thoroughly O
comprehend O
it. O
The O
imprudence O
was O
because O
of O
a O
lack O
of O
physical O
capacity O
and O
not O
from O
any O
deficiency O
of O
mental O
understanding O
. O
There O
was O
also O
a O
failure O
to O
show O
the O
existence O
of O
a O
fiduciary O
relation O
between O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
and O
Higgins O
or O
Mrs. O
Higgins. O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
were O
brokers O
for O
Higgins. O
He O
was O
, O
and O
had O
been O
for O
many O
years O
, O
a O
member O
of O
the O
Board O
of O
Trade. O
He O
could O
go O
into O
the O
pit O
personally O
and O
make O
trades O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
a O
clearing O
house O
member O
and O
could O
not O
clear O
his O
trades O
through O
the O
Board O
of O
Trade O
clearing O
house. O
He O
was O
obliged O
to O
deal O
through O
a O
broker O
*18who O
was O
a O
clearing O
house O
member. O
His O
numerous O
transactions O
were O
handled O
through O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
as O
brokers O
, O
and O
they O
, O
under O
the O
rules O
of O
the O
Board O
of O
Trade O
, O
became O
principals O
in O
the O
contracts O
made O
for O
him. O
The O
relation O
of O
broker O
and O
client O
is O
not O
of O
itself O
a O
fiduciary O
relation O
in O
regard O
to O
any O
dealings O
outside O
of O
that O
relation. O
An O
actual O
fiduciary O
relation O
may O
be O
shown O
in O
respect O
to O
other O
matters O
but O
it O
does O
not O
arise O
because O
of O
the O
relation O
of O
broker O
and O
client. O
A O
fiduciary O
relation O
, O
however O
, O
is O
not O
limited O
to O
cases O
of O
trustee O
and O
cestui O
que O
trust O
, O
guardian O
and O
ward O
, O
attorney O
and O
client O
, O
or O
other O
recognized O
legal O
relations O
, O
but. O
it O
exists O
in O
all O
cases O
in O
which O
influence O
has O
been O
acquired O
and O
abused O
, O
in O
which O
confidence O
has O
been O
reposed O
and O
betrayed. O
The O
origin O
of O
the O
confidence O
is O
immaterial. O
It O
may O
be O
moral O
, O
social O
, O
domestic O
, O
or O
merely O
personal. O
If O
the O
confidence O
in O
fact O
exists O
, O
is O
reposed O
by O

Arthur O
S. O
Jackson O
testified O
that O
Higgins O
was O
in O
the.habit O
of O
going O
to O
the O
cashier O
and O
getting O
$25 O
or O
$50 O
whenever.he O
needed O
*19it O
, O
and' O
the O
firm O
paid O
bills O
for O
him O
only O
on O
his O
instructions. O
The O
only O
relation O
established O
by O
this O
evidence O
is O
that O
of O
debtor O
and O
creditor. O
Higgins\u2019 O
credit O
was O
good O
, O
he O
had O
a O
credit O
balance O
on O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co.\u2019s O
books O
, O
he O
believed O
in O
their O
honesty O
and O
integrity O
as O
they O
did O
in O
his O
, O
and O
on O
his O
request O
they O
paid O
bills O
for O
him O
or O
advanced O
him O
money. O
There O
was O
no O
special O
confidence O
reposed O
in O
these O
transactions O
on O
either O
side. O
It O
was O
an O
ordinary O
method O
of O
dealing O
with O
a O
great O
many O
customers O
in O
the O
payment- O
of O
bills O
according O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
Arthur O
S. O
Jackson O
, O
which O
is O
not O
contradicted O
, O
and O
the O
firm O
charged O
nothing O
for O
it O
, O
being O
purely O
an O
accommodation O
. O
The O
bill O
charged O
that O
Higgins O
had O
placed O
$100 O
, O

with O
the O
Merchants O
Loan O
and O
Trust O
Company O
in O
trust O
for O
his O
wife O
but O
had O
retained O
the O
right O
to O
direct O
in O
what O
securities O
the O
money O
should O
be O
invested; O
that O
in O
1916 O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
received O
from O
him O
two O
checks O
of O
the O
Merchants O
Loan O
and O
Trust O
Company O
for O
$50 O
, O
000 O
each; O
that O
they O
knew O
of O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
trust O
fund O
, O
and O
, O
by O
some O
inducement O
unknown O
to O
the O
complainant O
, O
induced O
Higgins O
to O
direct O
the O
investment O
of O
the O
money O
in O
two O
notes O
of O
Higgins O
for O
$50 O
, O
000 O
each; O
that O
this O
was O
done O
and O
checks O
for O
these O
amounts O
were O
given O
to O
Higgins O
, O
which O
he O
delivered O
to O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
of O
any O
effort O
to O
influence O
Higgins O
to O
turn O
this O
fund O
over O
to O
Jackson O

or O
to O
make O
the O
deed O
to O
the O
Chicago O
Title O
\u25a0 O
and O
Trust O
Company. O
The O
deed O
was O
made O
to O
the O
grantee O
as O
trustee O
, O
under O
the O
provisions O
of O
a O
trust O
agreement O
of O
the O
same O
date O
known O
as O
trust O
No. O
7388. O
The O
trust O
agreement O
was O
between O
the O
Chicago O
Title O
and O
Trust O
Company O
and O
Arthur O
S. O
Jackson. O
Neither O
Higgins O
nor O
his O
wife O
was O
a O
party O
to O
it. O
McNabb O
testified O
that O
it O
was O
explained O
to O
the O
complainant O
and O
her O
husband O
that O
the O
title O
was O
taken O
by O
the O
title O
and O
trust O
company O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
Jackson; O
that O
he O
wanted O
it O
that O
way O
, O
and O
it O
was O
not O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
another O
mortgage O
but O
the O
title O
and O
trust O
company O
would O
hold O
*20it O
for O
Arthur O
Jackson. O
Higgins O
said O
that O
he O
understood O
it O
and O
it O
was O
immaterial O
to O
whom O
they O
made O
the O
deed O
. O
On O
the O
question O
of O
the O
fiduciary O
character O
of O
the O
relation O
between O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
and O
Higgins O
, O
evidence O
was O
given O
of O
certain O
statements\u2019 O
of O
Howard O
B. O
Jackson O
, O
a O
partner O
in O
the O
firm O
of O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
, O
who O
died O
after O
this O
suit O
was O
brought. O
Mrs. O
Van O
Thompson O
testified O
that O
Jackson O
was O
in O
charge O
of O
Higgins\u2019 O
funeral O
and O
that O
after O
the O
funeral O
she O
had O
a O
conversation O
with O
him O
, O
in O
which O
she O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
thought O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
would O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
the O
home O
, O
and O
he O
said: O
\u201cNo; O
I O
don\u2019t O
think O
she O
will O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
the O
home O
in O
its O
present O
condition O
, O
but O
as O
her O
agent O
, O
-and O
as O
our O
firm O
has O
handled O
and O
has O
done O
business O
for O
Mr. O
Higgins O
and O
are O
continuing O
to O
do O
it O
for O
her O
and O
as O
her O
agents O
, O
we O
will O
sell O
the O
property O
for O
her O
and O
invest O
the O
proceeds O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
and O
in O
such O
securities O
as O
will O
bring O
her O
a O
good O
income O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
life O
and O
take O
care O
of O
her O
very O
nicely O
indeed.\u201d O
Mrs. O
Conlin O
was O
present O
at O
this O
conversation O
, O
and O
testified: O
\u201cI O
saw O
Mr. O
Howard O
Jackson O
, O
and O
I O
heard O
him O
say O
to O
Mrs. O
Van O
Thompson: O
\u2018You O
know O
we O
are O
Mrs. O
Higgins\u2019 O
agents O
and O
we O
are O
going O
to O
'take O
care O
of O
her O
, O
and O
it O
won\u2019t O
be O
possible O
for O
her O
to O
keep O
up O
the O
home O
and O
keep O
up O
the O
expenses O
of O
the O
home O
, O
so O
we O
are O
going O
to O
dispose O
of O
the O
home O
and O
invest O
it O
in O
such O
a O
manner O
as O
to O
give O
her O
an O
income O
and O
take O
care O
of O
her O
comfortably O
as O
long O
as O
she O
lives.\u2019 O
\u201d O
Dr. O
Vaughan O
, O
who O
treated O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
in O
1918 O
, O
after O
her O
husband\u2019s O
death O
, O
testified O
that O
her O
condition O
seemed O
to O
be O
dependent O
largely O
on O
financial O
worry. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
what O
her O
situation O
was. O
She O
told O
him O
that O
Jackson O
would O
probably O
know O
but O
she O
could O
not O
get O
any O
satisfactory O
information. O
Upon O
his O
suggestion O
, O
and O
with O
her O
consent O
, O
Dr. O
Vaughan O
called O
upon O
Jackson O
at O
his O
office. O
He O
testified O
further: O
\u201cI O
explained O
the O
situation O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
said O
he O
would O
very O
gladly O
tell O
me O
all O
there O
was O
to O
be O
told O
, O
and O
said O
that O
the O
financial O
condition O
, O
compared O
with O
what O
*21her O
former O
mode O
of O
life O
had O
been O
, O
was O
, O
in O
a O
sense O
, O
very O
serious. O
He O
said: O
\u2018If O
you O
or O
somebody O
else O
could O
persuade O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
to O
dispose O
of O
her O
present O
home O
and O
live O
in O
a O
more O
modest O
way O
there O
would O
be O
sufficient O
income O
to O
take O
care O
of O
her O
as O
long O
as O
she O
ordinarily O
would O
live.\u2019 O
I O
said: O
\u2018May O
I O
go O
back O
and O
tell O
her O
that O
she O
has O
no O
worry O
financially O
, O
and O
that O
she O
will O
be O
properly O
cared O
for O
, O
and O
can O
be O
as O
long O
as O
she O
lives O
, O
with O
what O
resources O
there O
are?\u2019 O
and O
he O
said: O
\u2018You O
may O
, O
and O
also O
tell O
her O
from O
me O
that O
my O
friendship O
for O
her O
husband O
was O
such O
that O
I O
would O
certainly O
do O
the O
best O
for O
her O
that O
anybody O
can O
possibly O
do.\u2019 O
\u201d O
In O
the O
spring O
of O
1920 O
, O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
having O
advertised O
for O
sale O
the O
Higgins O
home O
, O
Dr. O
L. O
C. O
Ziegler O
called O
there O
with O
a O
view O
to O
buying O
it O
, O
and O
.afterwards O
, O
as O
he O
testified O
, O
Howard O
B. O
Jackson O
called O
upon O
him O
and O
said: O
\u201cThis O
is O
Mr. O
Howard O
Jackson O
, O
of O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
We O
are O
the O
agents O
and O
representatives O
of O
Mrs. O
Higgins. O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
informs O
us O
that O
you O
called O
at O
her O
home O
to O
investigate O
the O
home O
and O
that O
you O
inspected O
the O
home O
with O
reference O
to O
purchasing O
the O
same. O
She O
also O
informed O
us O
that O
you O
expressed O
a O
desire O
to O
deal O
with O
her O
directly O
, O
as O
principal O
and O
owner O
of O
the O
property. O
Now O
, O
any O
negotiations O
that O
you O
might O
enter O
into O
with O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
would O
be O
frowned O
upon O
by O
her O
relatives O
and O
friends O
, O
because O
they O
have O
long O
been O
cognizant O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
both O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
were O
absolutely O
incompetent O
and O
incapable O
of O
transacting O
any O
business O
of O
any O
character O
whatever.\u201d O
The O
doctor O
testified O
to O
the O
further O
statement O
that O
the O
deed O
had O
been O
given O
simply O
and O
solely O
as O
a O
business O
convenience. O
As O
Jackson O
had O
for O
several O
years O
acted O
as O
Higgins\u2019 O
agent O
he O
advised O
Higgins O
to O
do O
this O
, O
so O
that O
in O
case O
it O
became O
necessary O
to O
make O
this O
turn O
he O
could O
do O
it O
, O
\u201cbut O
the O
property O
was O
, O
and O
always O
had O
been O
, O
the O
property O
of O
Mrs. O
Higgins.\u201d O
Eleanor O
Barnett O
, O
who O
was O
then O
employed O
by O
Dr. O
Ziegler O
, O
was O
present O
and O
heard O
the O
conversation. O
Her O
version O
was O
that O
Jackson O
said O
the O
property O
now O
, O
and O
always O
had O
, O
belonged O
*22to O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
, O
but O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
Jackson O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
had O
made O
the O
deed O
as O
a O
business O
convenience O
in O
case O
it O
became O
necessary O
to O
turn O
the O
property O
in O
any O
way O
; O
that O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
had O
been O
the O
agents O
of O
Higgins O
for O
several O
years; O
that O
Higgins O
was O
not O
really O
mentally O
capable O
, O
and O
Jackson O
had O
taken O
care O
of O
all O
of O
his O
business O
, O
making O
out O
his O
checks O
and O
everything O
of O
that O
sort. O
\u201cI O
didn\u2019t O
take O
it O
that O
at O
the O
time O
this O
conveyance O
was O
made O
he O
didn\u2019t O
think O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
was O
mentally O
competent O
, O
but O
that O
it O
was O
more O
because O
she O
had O
no O
ideas O
of O
business O
ways O
or O
methods O
, O
and O
it O
was O
simply O
that O
she O
followed O
the O
advice O
given O
her.\u201d O
These O
statements O
.cannot O
be O
regarded O
as O
indicating O
that O
the O
relation O
of O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
to O
Higgins O
in O
his O
lifetime O
was O
a O
fiduciary O
relation. O
The O
language O
in O
which O
they O
were O
expressed O
may O
not O
have O
been O
accurately O
used O
, O
it O
may O
not O
have O
been O
correctly O
understood O
, O
and O
it O
may O
not O
have O
been O
precisely O
repeated. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
the O
first O
three O
witnesses O
, O
the O
time O
and O
circumstances O
would O
indicate O
the O
friendly O
purpose O
of O
the O
speaker O
rather O
than O
an O
exact O
statement. O
It O
seems O
rather O
singular O
that O
the O
statements O
testified O
to O
by O
the O
doctor O
should O
have O
been O
made O
under O
the O
circumstances O
, O
but O
in O
any O
event O
they O
do O
not O
of O
themselves O
show O
a O
fiduciary O
relation O
or O
fraud. O
If O
they O
were O
actually O
made O
as O
testified O
to O
, O
they O
could O
do O
no O
more O
than O
excite O
a O
suspicion O
that O
some O
detail O
of O
the O
whole O
transaction O
has O
not O
been O
revealed. O
They O
certainly O
do O
not O
constitute O
evidence O
of O
the O
clear O
, O
certain O
and O
definite O
character O
required O
to O
set O
aside O
a O
deed O
. O
The O
evidence O
does O
not O
sustain O
the O
appellant\u2019s O
claim O
of O
fraud. O
The O
physical O
weakness O
of O
the O
complainant\u2019s O
husband O
and O
its O
effect O
on O
his O
mental O
ability O
, O
the O
anxiety O
and O
distress O
of O
the O
complainant O
, O
her O
inexperience O
in O
business O
and O
her O
reliance O
upon O
her O
husband O
, O
the O
testimony O
of O
their O
friends O
and O
physicians O
as O
to O
their O
physical O
and O
mental O
weakness O
, O
must O
all O
be O
taken O
into O
consideration O
, O
but O
after O
these O
are O
all O
given O
their O
due O
weight O
there O
remains O
no O
serious O
doubt O
that. O
*23Higgins O
thoroughly O
understood O
the O
transaction O
and O
voluntarily O
and O
with O
full O
understanding O
executed O
the O
deed O
, O
and O
that O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
, O
relying O
upon O
her O
husband\u2019s O
knowledge O
and O
judgment O
with O
full O
confidence O
, O
also O
willingly O
executed O
the O
deed O
with O
full O
knowledge O
of O
its O
character O
and O
effect. O
She O
testified: O
\u201cCertainly O
I O
understood O
the O
paper O
I O
signed O
in O
the O
office O
was O
a O
deed. O
My O
husband O
told O
me O
that.\u201d O
She O
had O
had O
no O
business O
experience O
but O
was O
always O
in O
the O
habit O
of O
signing O
anything O
he O
asked O
her O
to O
sign. O
The O
instrument O
was O
explained O
to O
her O
, O
she O
acted O
upon O
the O
only O
counsel O
she O
ever O
sought O
, O
she O
was O
not O
imposed O
upon O
, O
deceived O
or O
misled O
, O
and O
she O
cannot O
, O
under O
these O
circumstances O
, O
be O
relieved O
from O
the O
consequences O
of O
her O
act O
. O
A O
large O
part O
of O
the O
appellant\u2019s O
brief O
is O
devoted O
to O
a O
consideration O
of O
the O
character O
of O
the O
dealings O
between O
Higgins O
and O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
It O
is O
claimed O
they O
consisted O
entirely O
of O
gambling O
transactions O
, O
out O
of O
which O
no O
liability O
arose; O
that O
they O
resulted O
in O
losses O
of O
large O
sums O
by O
Higgins; O
that O
the O
notes O
which O
constituted O
the O
consideration O
for O
the O
deed O
in O
question O
were O
given O
in O
settlement O
of O
such O
losses O
, O
and O
were O
therefore O
void O
and O
constituted O
no O
consideration O
for O
the O
conveyance. O
The O
consideration O
of O
the O
deed O
was O
two O
notes O
, O
one O
for O
$30 O
, O
000 O
, O
dated O
November O
11 O
, O
1916 O
, O
the O
other O
for O
$10 O
, O
000 O
, O
dated O
May O
16 O
, O
1917 O
, O
each O
secured O
by O
a O
mortgage O
on O
the O
premises O
in O
question. O
The O
evidence O
does O
not O
show O
that O
losses O
incurred O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
transactions O
of O
Higgins O
with O
Jackson O
Bros. O
&amp; O
Co. O
formed O
the O
consideration O

these O

or O
any O
part O
of O
the O
consideration. O
The O
circumstances O
under O
which O
they O
were O
given O
are O
not O

All O
that O
appears O
in O
the O

is O
that O
Arthur O
S. O
Jackson O
held O
them O
on O
January O
5 O
, O
1918 O
, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
canceled O

upon O

the O

that O

Mrs. O

The O

alleged O
that O

to O
them O
upon O

notes O
which O
constituted O

No O

All O
the O

by O

The O

McNabb O
were O
the O
only O
witnesses O
who O
testified O
as O
to O
what O
occurred O
at O
the O
execution O
of O
the O
deed O
, O
and O
the O
court O
, O
from O
seeing O

them O
, O
was O
better O

to O

to O

than O
a O

which O

only O
the O

Complaint O
is O
made O
of O
the O
action O
of O
the O
court O
in O
not O
permitting O
Dr. O
Bachelle O
to O
give O
his O
opinion O
, O
on O
direct O
examination O
, O
of O
the O
competency O
and O
ability O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
to O
transact O
business O
in O
January O
, O
1918. O
He O
did O
testify O
that O
in O
his O
opinion O
Higgins O
was O
not O
mentally O
in O
a O
condition O
to O
transact O
business O
between O
November O
, O
1917 O
, O
and O
his O
death. O
His O
statement O
at O
one O
time O
in O
his O
examination O
that O
Higgins O
was O
not O
entirely O
normal O
was O
stricken O
out O
as O
being O
too O
general O
, O
but O
later O
he O
gave O
the O
same O
testimony O
without O
objection. O
He O
stated O
his O
conclusion O
that O
Higgins O
was O
not O
able O
to O
be O
running O
around O
by O
himself O
or O
going O
out O
and O
doing O
business O
, O
and O
this O
was O
stricken O
out O
, O
but O
the O
facts O
which O
he O
detailed O
on O
which O
he O
based O
his O
conclusion O
remained. O
He O
was O
not O
permitted O
to O
give O
his O
opinion O
as O
to O
the O
ability O
of O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
to O
transact O
business O
in O
the O
month O
of O
January. O
This O
was O
the O
ultimate O
question O
for O
the O
court O
to O
determine O
and O
not O
for O
the O
witness O
to O
decide O
, O
though O
he O
might O
have O
testified O
as O
to O
whether O
in O
his O
opinion O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Higgins O
were O
of O
sound O
or O
unsound O

The O

an O

for O
injuries O
received O
in O
the O
course O
of O

with O
the O
plaintiff O

He O
was O
injured O
by O
the O
falling O

He O
received O
a O
severe O
cut O
on O
his O
head O
, O
a O
bruise O
on O
his O
shoulder O
and O
his O
right O
foot O
was O
injured. O
He O
returned O
to O
work O
five O
weeks O
after O
the O
injury O
, O
and O
the O
evidence O
shows O
that O
shortly O
thereafter O
there O
developed O
a O
dizziness O
, O
characterized O
by O
him O
in O
his O
testimony O
as O
\u201chead O

These O
seizures O
come O
upon O
him O
about O
once O
a O
week. O
When O
seized O
he O
falls O
in O
a O
manner O
similar O
to O
an O
apoplectic O
seizure. O
The O
medical O
testimony O
of O
the O
physician O
who O
attended O
him O
characterized O
his O
ailment O
as O
Jacksonian O
apoplexy. O
- O
In O
answer O
to O
a O
hypothetical O
question O
setting O
out O
the O
injury O
as O
testified O
to O
by O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
, O
he O
stated O
that O
he O
was O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
condition O
was O
brought O
about O
by O
traumatic O
injury O
to O
the O
head. O
In O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
physician O
testifying O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
the O
dizzy O
spells O
were O
the O
result O
of O
disturbances O
of O
the O
centers O
of O
equilibrium O
and O
were O
connected O
with O
the O
ear. O
The O
record O
shows O
that O
in O
1913 O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
had O
lost O
the O
hearing O
in O
his O
left O
ear. O
Defendant O
in O
error\u2019s O
testimony O
shows O
him O
to O
be O
a O
man O
thirty-two O
years O
of O
age O
, O
who O
prior O
to O
his O
injury O
had O
never O
suffered O
any O
of O
the O
symptoms O
of O
dizziness O
or O
seizures O
of O
unconsciousness; O
that O
they O
had O
gradually O
developed O
, O
beginning O
some O
weeks O
after O
his O
injury O
, O
and O
the O
record O
shows O
that O
at O
the O
hearing O
on O
review O
before O
the O
commission O
his O
condition O
had O
not O
improved. O
The O
arbitrator O
found O
a O
temporary O
partial O
loss O
of O
the O
use O
of O
the O
injured O
leg O
and O
permanent O
partial O
disability O
arising O
out O
of O
injury O
to O

, O
and O
entered O
an O
award O
for O
temporary O
loss O
of O
the O
use O
of O

awarded O
$8.36 O
per O
week O
for O
a O
period O
of O
409 O

As O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
the O
defendant O
in O
error\u2019s O
medical O
testimony O
is O
to O
that O
effect. O
The O
medical O
witness O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
while O
ascribing O
the O
disease O
to O
the O
ear O
as O
the O
cause O
, O
does O
not O
testify O
that O
such O
symptoms O
would O
not O
be O
produced O
by O
trauma O
, O
and O
it O
is O
undisputed O
that O
defendant O
in O
error O
received O
a O
severe O
gash O
in O
the O
scalp O
by O
the O
falling O
slate. O
We O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
the O
arbitrator O
and O
the O
commission O
were O
justified O
in O
finding O
that O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
defendant O
in O
error O
was O
brought O
about O
by O
the O
injury O
he O
received O
in O
the O
mine O
. O
It O
is O
also O
contended O
that O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
weekly O
award O
was O
not O
justified O
by O
the O
evidence. O
The O
defendant O
in O
error O
testified O
that O
prior O
to O
being O
injured O
he O
mined O
on O
an O
average O
twelve O
to O
fourteen O
tons O
of O
coal O
per O
day; O
that O
since O
his O
injury O
his O
average O
was O
not O
over O
seven O
and O
a O
half O
tons. O
The O
price O
received O
for O
mining O
was O
$1.04 O
per O
ton. O
The O
decrease O
in O
his O
earning O
capacity O
would O
be O
, O
by O
these O
figures O
, O
four O
and O
a O
half O
tons O
per O
day O
, O
or O
a O
difference O
of O
$4.68 O
per O
day. O
These O
figures O
easily O
justify O
, O
under O
the O
statute O
, O
an O
award O
for O
$8.36 O
per O
week O
for O
permanent O
partial O
disability O

and O
in O
the O
course O
of O
his O

and O
which O
resulted O
in O
his O
death O
the O

day. O
His O
mother O
, O
Lucy O
Clayton O
, O
applied O
to O
the O
Industrial O

for O
compensation O
, O
alleging O
that O
she O
was O
totally O
dependent O
upon O
the O
earnings O
of O
the O
deceased O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
injury. O
An O

, O
after O

, O
made O
an O

$1650 O
, O
\u2014 O
the O

Clayton O
, O
the O
mother O
of O
Virgil O
Clayton O
, O
lived O
at O
Providence O
, O
Kentucky O
, O
and O
was O
the O
only O
witness. O
Until O
about O
a O
year O
before O
the O
death O
of O
Virgil O
he O
lived O
with O
his O
father O
, O
mother O
and O
family O
at O
Providence. O
His O
father O
had O
been O
a O
farmer O
and O
was O
a O
coal O
miner O
, O
and O
Virgil O
worked O
as O
a O
miner O
for O
the O
Hunter O
Coal O
Company. O
Whenever O
Virgil O
drew O
his O
pay O
he O
contributed O
money O
for O
the O
support O
of O
the O
family O
and O
himself O
, O
including O
his O
own O
board O
, O
and O
the O
amount O
so O
contributed O
was O
probably O
about O
$30 O
a O
month. O
He O
left O
home O
a O
year O
before O
his O
death O
and O
came O
to O
Harrisburg O
, O
where O
he O
worked O
as O
a O
miner O
for O
the O
Wasson O
Coal O
Company O
until O
the O
accident O
which O
caused O
his O
death. O
After O
he O
came O
to O
this O
State O
he O
never O
sent O
any O
money O
to O
his O
father O
or O
mother O
but O
gave O
his O
father O
some O
money O
on O
two O
occasions O
when O
he O
went O
home O
, O
and O
the O
amount O
was O
not O
shown. O
The O
witness O
thought O
he O
gave O
money O
to O
his O
father O
some O
time O
in O
July O
, O
1921 O
, O
when O
he O
was O
home. O
His O
father O
died O
on O
November O
13 O

Virgil O
was O
twenty-three O
years O
old O
at O
his O
death. O
He O
went O
home O
to O
the O
funeral O
of O
his O
father O
but O
gave O
no O
money O
to O
the O
claimant O
then O
or O
at O
any O
other O
time O
afterward. O
He O
contemplated O
marriage O
and O
informed O
his O
mother O
about O
it O
, O
and O
said O
if O
she O
did O
not O
want O
him O
to O
marry O
he O
would O
not. O
While O
the O
father O
was O
living O
the O
claimant O
was O
dependent O
upon O
him O
and O
not O
upon O
Virgil O
, O
although O
he O
contributed O
to O
the O
family O
expenses O
until O
he O
left O
home. O
After O
the O
death O
of O
the O
father O
the O
claimant O
was O
dependent O
on O
her O
own O
earnings O
and O
that O
of O
the O
members O
of O
*244her O
family. O
The O
day O
before O
Virgil O
was O
killed O
he O
wrote O
that O
he O
was O
coming O
home O
the O
last O
of O
the O
month O
and O
would O
bring O
some O
money O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
probability O
that O

would O
return O

some O

the O
bill O
asked O
that O
his O
widow O
be O
decreed O
to O
&gt; O
hold O
the O
title O
to O
the O
undivided O
one-half O
of O
the O
160 O
acres O
in O
trust O
and O
to O
the O
whole O
of O
the O
30 O
acres. O
The O
bill O
also O
alleged O
there O
was O
$5000 O
in O
money O
on O
deposit O
in O
a O
bank O
, O
which O
belonged O
to O
Reid O
, O
and O
asked O
that O
that O
be O
partitioned O
also. O
Julia O
A. O
Reid O
and O
her O
two O
children O
, O
Walter O
and O
Mollie O
, O
answered O
the O
bill O
, O
denying O
the O
material O
allegations O
and O
alleging O
that O
Mrs. O
Reid O
paid O
the O
entire O
consideration O
for O
the O
160 O
acres O
out O
of O
her O
own O
means O
, O
which O
she O
inherited O
from O
her O
former O
husband O
, O
and O
that O
the O
30 O
acres O
was O
purchased O
in O
1893 O
for O
$700 O
, O
and O
was O
paid O
for O
, O
$50 O
in O
cash O
and O
$650 O
by O
borrowed O
money O
, O
and O
that O
the O
borrowed O
money O
was O
repaid O
by O
timber O
sold O
off O
of O
the O
160 O
acres. O
The O
answer O
also O
averred O
that O
the O
improvements O
on O
the O
farm O
were O
made O
out O
of O
the O
proceeds O
from O
it O
, O
and O
that O
they O
were O
managed O
and O
directed O
by O
Mrs. O
Reid. O
The O
cause O
was O
tried O
before O
the O
chancellor O
, O
and O
a O
decree O
entered O
dismissing O
the O
bill O
as O
to O
the O
160 O
acres O
of O
land O
and O
the O
personal O
property. O
The O
decree O
found O
that O
Reid O
paid O
the O
$700 O
purchase O
price O
for O
the O
30 O
acres O
out O
of O
his O
own O
money O
, O
but O
in O
order O
to O
keep O
peace O
in O
his O
family O
he O
had O
it O
deeded O
to O
his O
wife O
to O
hold O
in O
trust O
for O
him O
, O
and O
that O
at O
his O
death O
she O
held O
the O
title O
in O
trust O
for O
her O
husband O
and O
was O
entitled O
to O
dower O
therein. O
Commis*55sioners O
were O
appointed O
to O
assign O
dower O
and O
make O
partition O
of O
the O
30 O
acres O
between O
the O
four O
Reid O
children O
, O
and O
the O
widow O
and O
her O
two O
children O
by O
her O
deceased O
husband O
have O
prosecuted O
this O
appeal O
from O
that O
part O
of O
the O
decree O
. O
When O
the O
160 O
acres O
was O
purchased O
the O
most O
of O
it O
was O
uncleared O
timber O
land. O
Soon O
after O
its O
purchase O
Reid O
and O
his O
wife O
moved O
on O
the O
land O
, O
and O
he O
began O
clearing O
the O
timber O
off O
of O
it O
, O
or O
had O
it O
cleared O
off O
, O
and O
fenced O
and O
improved O
it O
with O
buildings. O
Improvements O
costing O
several O
thousand O
dollars O
were O
made O
on O
the O
land. O
Reid O
was O
a O
carpenter O
and O
did O
a O
good O
part O
of O
the O
work O
erecting O
buildings O
himself. O
He O
also O
raised O
and O
marketed O
grain O
, O
hay O
and O
livestock O
, O
sometimes O
shipping O
car-load O
lots. O
The O
30-acre O
tract O
was O
purchased O
in O
1893. O
It O
also O
was O
timbered O
, O
and O
Reid O
began O
improvement O
by O
clearing O
off O
that O
land. O
He O
must O
have O
done O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
carpenter O
work O
for O
other O
people O
, O
as O
one O
of O
his O
sons O
by O
his O
first O
wife O
testified O
he O
had O
built O
forty-eight O
houses O
and O
barns. O
All O
but O
$50 O
of O
the O
purchase O
price O
was O
paid O
to O
the O
vendor O
out O
of O
money O
borrowed O
on O
a O
note O
given O
by O
the O
Reids O
and O
signed O
by O
some O
other O
people O
, O
which O
was O
afterwards O
paid O
off. O
Mrs. O
Reid O
testified O
it O
was O
paid O
with O
timber O
sold O
off O
of O
the O
160-acre O
tract O
, O
while O
one O
witness O
for O
appellees O
testified O
he O
lived O
near O
the O
Reid O
farm O
and O
that O
the O
timber O
sold O
off O
that O
land O
was O
sold O
eight O
or O
ten O
years O
before O
the O
purchase O
of O
the O
30-acre O
tract O
. O
No O
question O
is O
raised O
as O
to O
the O
correctness O
of O
the O
decree O
in O
dismissing O
the O
bill O
as O
to O
the O
160 O
acres O
, O
and O
we O
think O
the O
proof O
shows O
that O
the O
improvements O
made O
on O
that O
tract O
were O
almost O
entirely O
made O
by O
the O
labor O
and O
management O
of O
Reid. O
He O
owned O
nothing O
unless O
he O
had O
an O
interest O
in O
that O
land O
and O
the O
personal O
property O
thereon O
as O
the O
proceeds O
of O
it. O
Mrs. O
Reid O
claimed O
all O
the O
property O
on O
the O
farm O
, O
and O
appellant O
Mollie O
Reid O
testified O
that O
when O
her O
father O
died O
he O
owned O
no O
property O
, O
to O
her O
knowledge O
. O
While O
the O
160-acre O
tract O
is O
not O
involved O
in O
the O
appeal O
, O
it O
seems O
not O
improper O
to O
refer O
in O
a O
general O
way O
to O
the O
proof O
*56relating O
to O
that O
tract O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
30 O
acres. O
It O
was O
agreed O
by O
counsel O
that O
all O
the O
parties O
to O
the O
suit O
should O
be O
considered O
competent O
witnesses O
and O
all O
might O
testify. O
It O
appears O
from O
the O
testimony O
that O
Mrs. O
Reid O
inherited O
from O
her O
first O
husband O
some O
personal O
property. O
She O
claims O
from O
that O
property O
and O
a O
gift O
of O
$700 O
from O
her O
first O
husband O
before O
his O
death O
she O
paid O
the O
purchase O
price O
($1700) O
for O
the O
160-acre O
tract O
of O
land O
and O
that O
it O
was O
improved O
by O
the O
proceeds O
sold O
from O
the O
land O
, O
under O
her O
direction. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
it O
was O
testified O
that O
Mr. O
and O
Mrs. O
Reid O
had O
several O
discussions O
about O
the O
purchase O
of O
the O
land O
, O
in O
which O
Reid O
stated O
he O
had O
furnished O
one-half O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
it. O
However O
the O
fact O
may O
be O
as O
to O
that O
tract O
, O
there O
was O
no O
claim O
that O
the O
30 O
acres O
was O
paid O
for O
with O
money O
that O
Mrs. O
Reid O
received O
from O
her O
first O
husband. O
That O
tract O
was O
not O
bought O
till O
many O
years O
after O
the O
purchase O
of O
the O
160 O
acres O
, O
and O
it O
is O
quite O
evident O
the O
little O
property O
Mrs. O
Reid O
had O
received O
from O
her O
first O
husband O
had O
been O
used O
up O
before O
that O
time. O
Reid O
and O
his O
wife O
lived O
on O
the O
160 O
acres O
and O
farmed O
it O
forty-five O
years O
before O
his O
death. O
They O
possessed O
, O
improved O
and O
farmed O
the O
30 O
acres O
from O
the O
time O
it O
was O
purchased O
, O
in O
1893. O
The O
proof O
fairly O
shows O
Reid O
was O
an O
industrious O
, O
frugal O
and O
thrifty O
farmer. O
He O
raised O
on O
the O
farm O
and O
sold O
considerable O
quantities O
of O
grain O
, O
hay O
and O
livestock. O
In O
addition O
he O
was O
a O
good O
carpenter O
and O
built O
a O
large O
number O
of O
dwelling O
houses O
and O
barns O
for O
other O
people. O
The O
conclusion O
is O
warranted O
that O
his O
earnings O
from O
that O
source O
must O
have O
amounted O
to O
a O
substantial O
sum O
, O
and O
that O
when O
the O
30-acre O
tract O
was O
purchased O
he O
was O
able O
to O
earn O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
the O
note O
on O
which O
the O
money O
to O
pay O
for O
the O
land O
was O
borrowed. O
We O
cannot O
say O
the O
chancellor O
was O
not O
warranted O
by O
the O
evidence O
in O
finding O
that O
he O
did O
pay O
for O
it O
and O
that O
his O
wife O
held O
the O
title O
in O
trust O
. O
In O
our O
view O
it O
is O
unnecessary O
to O
refer O
to O
or O
discuss O
the O
authorities O
, O
as O
the O
proof O
required O
to O
establish O
a O
resulting O
trust O
and O
the O
presumption O
arising O
from O
a O
conveyance O
to O
the O
*57wife O
when O
the O
purchase O
money O
is O
paid O
by O
the O
husband O
are O
all O
well O
understood. O
Here O
it O
is O
not O
claimed O
Reid O
paid O
his O
own O
money O
for O
the O
land O
and O
made O
a O
gift O
of O
it O
to O
his O
wife O
, O
but O
the O
claim O
of O
appellants O
is O
that O
Mrs. O
Reid O
paid O
her O
own O
money O
for O
it O
, O
and O
her O
daughter O
testified O
that O
her O
father O
owned O
no O
property O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death. O
It O
seems O
incredible O
that O
such O
a O
man O
as O
the O
proof O
shows O
Reid O
was O
, O
having O
two O
children O
by O
a O
former O
wife O
, O
would O
give O
all O
his O
time O
and O
abilities O
for O
forty-five O
years O
to O
the O
accumulation O
of O
property O
for O
his O
second O
wife O
and O
his O
two O
children O
by O
her O
and O
leave O
nothing O
to O
his O
two O
children O
by O
his O
first O
wife O
, O
when O
no O
reason O
for O
his O
doing O
so O
is O
shown O
by O
the O
record. O
If O
Reid O
paid O
the O
purchase O
price O
for O
the O
30 O
acres O
, O
we O
think O
the O
chancellor O
was O
warranted O
in O
decreeing O
that O
he O
was O
the O
equitable O
owner O
and O
that O
Mrs. O
Reid O
held O
the O
title O
in O
trust O
for O
him. O
It O
is O
evident O
, O
we O
think O
, O
from O
the O
proof O
, O
that O
in O
order O
, O
as O
the O
bill O
alleges O
, O
to O
keep O
peace O
in O
the O
family O
Reid O
was O
very O
subject O
to O
obey O
the O
orders O
and O
directions O
of O
his O
wife O
, O
and O
for O
that O
reason O
the O
deed O
for O
the O
30 O
acres O
was O
made O
to O
her O
, O
not O
as O
a O
gift O
but O
to O
hold O
the O
legal O
title O
in O
trust. O
Every O
principle O
of O
justice O
demands O
that O
the O
appellees O
should O
share O
equally O
with O
their O
half-brother O
and O
half-sister O
at O
least O
in O
the O
30 O
acres. O
Appellants O
were O
given O
the O
sole O
benefit O
of O
forty-five O
years O
of O
the O
labor O
and O
earnings O
of O
their O
and O
appellees\u2019 O
father O
in O
improving O
and O
enhancing O
the O
value O
of O
the O
160 O
acres O
, O
and O
it O
would O
seem O
in O
all O
human O
justice O
they O
should O
be O
willing O
to O
share O
equally O
with O
appellees O
the O
30 O
acres. O
They O
do O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
willing O
to O
do O
so O
, O
but O
if O
the O
decree O
was O
warranted O
it O
obliges O
them O
to O
do O
that. O
We O
are O
of O
opinion O
the O
decree O
was O
warranted O
by O
the O
evidence. O
At O
all O
events O
, O
we O
cannot O
say O
it O
is O
so O
palpably O
contrary O
to O
the O
evidence O
that O
it O
should O
be O
reversed O
. O
The O
decree O
is O
therefore O
affirmed O

and O
asked O
the O
judge O
to O
continue O
the O
case O
until O
he O
could O
employ O
counsel O
to O
represent O
complainants. O
No O
motion O
for O
continuance O
, O
supported O
by O
affidavit O
, O
was O
presented O
to O
the O
court O
, O
and O
no O
showing O
that O
the O
bill O
was O
filed O
in O
good O
faith O
or O
that O
the O
suit O
would O
be O
diligently O
prosecuted O

made. O
Why O
reputable O
Peoria O
attorneys O
would O
not O
prosecute O
the O
suit O
does O
not O
appear O
from O
the O
record. O
The O
trial O
court O
, O
with O
all O
the O
facts O
before O
it O
, O
dismissed O
the O
case. O
In O
his O
affidavit O
in O
support O
of O
his O
motion O
*270to O
vacate O
the O
order O
dismissing O
the O
suit O
Brickwood O
states O
that O
he O
consulted O
Charles O
S. O
Deneen O
, O
of O
Chicago O
, O
and O
Dailey O
, O
Miller O
, O
McCormick O
&amp; O
Radley O
, O
of O
Peoria O
, O
with O
a O
view O
to O
arranging O
with O
them O
to O
try O
this O
case O
for O
complainants O
, O
but O
he O
does O
not O
state O
that O
he O
employed O
these O
attorneys O
or O
that O
he O
had O
authority O
to O
attach O
Deneen\u2019s O
name O
to O
the O
bill. O
He O
asserts O
that O
complainants O
have O
a O
just O
and O
meritorious O
cause O
of O
action O
and O
that O
they O
have O
expended O
a O
large O
sum O
of O
money O
in O
accumulating O
evidence O
to O
sustain O
the O
allegations O
of O
their O
bill O
, O
but O
he O
does O
not O
state O
to O
whom O
any O
of O
this O
money O
was O
paid. O
He O
states O
that O
he O
has O
, O
as O
agent O
of O
complainants O
, O
employed O
a O
reputable O
member O
of O
the O
Peoria O
bar O
to O
represent O
complainants O
in O
the O
trial O
of O
the O
cause O
, O
but O
he O
does O
not O
give O
the O
name O
of O
this O
attorney. O
Strange O
to O
say O
, O
the O
only O
person O
complaining O
to O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
its O
action O
in O
dismissing O
this O
bill O
was O
Brickwood. O
No O
member O
of O
the O
bar O
urged O
the O
circuit O
court O
to O
re-instate O
the O
case O
, O
and O
none O
of O
the O
complainants O
ever O
, O
directly O
or O
indirectly O
, O
advised O
the O
circuit O
court O
that O
Brickwood O
ever O
had O
any O
authority O
to O
file O
this O
bill O
or O
that O
they O
have O
any O
objection O
to O
its O
dismissal. O
The O
bill O
alleges O
that O
five O
of O
the O
complainants O
reside O
in O
Peoria O
county O
, O
two O
in O
Fulton O
county O
and O
two O
in O
Cook O
county. O
As O
far O
as O
this O
record O
shows O
all O
of O
them O
are O
adults O
, O
and O
if O
they O
have O
a O
meritorious O
cause O
it O
is O
strange O
that O
they O
did O
not O
employ O
a O
reputable O
attorney O
to O
present O
their O
cause O
in O
the O
circuit O
court. O
Nothing O
appears O
of O
record O
that O
explains O
their O
acting O
through O
Brickwood O
as O
agent. O
The O
matter O
before O
us O
for O
review O
is O
the O
action O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
complainants O
are O
now O
represented O
by O
reputable O
attorneys O
does O
not O
change O
the O
record O
made O
in O
the O
trial O
court O
. O
The O
circuit O
court O
properly O
dismissed O
the O
bill O
for O
want O
of O
prosecution O
and O
did O
not O
abuse O
its O
discretion O

A O
plea O
was O

filed O
by O

and O
demurred O
to O
by O

, O
but O
afterwards O
by O

the O

were O
withdrawn O
, O
and O
by O
agreement O
it O
was O
stipulated O
that O
the O
only O
questions O
involved O
for O

were O
(1) O
whether O
the O
territory O

the O

was O
compact O

and O
(2) O
whether O
the O

embraced O

it O
was O
agreed O
that O
the O
hearing O

It O

so O
*199heard O
and O
the O

was O
dismissed O
at O

cost O
, O
from O
which O
judgment O
he O
has O
prosecuted O
this O
appeal O
. O
The O
district O
contains O
the O
equivalent O
of O
seventy-one O
sections O
of O
land O
in O
Greene O
and O
Macoupin O
counties. O
Its O
greatest O
distance O
north O
and O
south O
is O
nine O
and O
one-half O
miles O
and O
from O
east O
to O
west O
nine O

The O
school O
house O
is O
in O
Greenfield O
, O
a O
village O
in O
said O
district O
having O
a O
population O
of O
about O
1200. O
The O
village O
is O
about O
three O
and O
one-half O
miles O
from O
the O
western O
boundary O
and O
about O
the O
same O
distance O
from O
the O

It O
is O
six O
miles O
from O
the O
north O
boundary O
and O
approximately O
five O
miles O
from O
the O
east O
boundary. O
The O
highways O
in O
the O
district O
arc O
dirt O
roads. O
Some O
of O
them O
are O
State O
aid O
and O
some O

not O

but O
some O

Three O

run O
through O
certain O

The O
affidavits O
of O
the O
respective O
parties O
are O
too O
numerous O
and O
lengthy O
to O
set O
out O
in O
substance. O
Those O
on O
the O
part O
of O

are O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
at O
times O
during O
the O
school O

the O
roads O
are O
impassable O
at O
certain O
places O
for O
periods O
of O
from O
a O
few O
to O
several O
days; O
that O
on O
account O
of O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
roads O
in O
bad O
weather O
and O
the O
distance O
some O
of O
the O
pupils O
must O
travel O
to O
go O
to O
the O
school O
they O
cannot O
regularly O

but O
are O
deprived O
of O

of O

unless O

which O
some O
of O

cannot O
afford O
to O
do. O
Substantially O
all O
of O
appellant\u2019s O
affidavits O
were O
made O
by O
residents O
of O
the O
district O
living O
outside O

some O
of O

The O

all O
of O
whom O
testified O
they O
were O
familiar O
with O
the O
roads O
, O
streams O
and O
conditions O
in O
the O
district. O
If O
their O
affidavits O
are O
to O
be O
believed O
, O
the O
roads O
in O
the O
district O
are O
in O
good O
condition O
throughout O
the O
year. O
They O
are O
well O
graded O
, O
regularly O
dragged O
, O
efficiently O
drained O
and O
kept O
in O
good O
repair. O
A O
number O
of O
the O
appellees\u2019 O
witnesses O
stated O
the O
roads O
were O
passable O
by O
automobiles O
85 O
to O
90 O
per O
cent O
of O
the O
year O
and O
by O
horse-drawn O
vehicles O
the O
entire O
year. O
With O
the O
exception O
of O
an O
unprecedented O
flood O
in O
the O
spring O
of O
1922 O
, O
which O
did O
considerable O
damage O
and O
made O
the O
roads O
impassable O
for O
a O
while O
, O
they O
have O
been O
in O
good O
condition O
all O
the O
time. O
Since O
the O
spring O
of O
1922 O
they O
have O
been O
repaired O
and O
the O
grade O
raised O
where O
needed. O
The O
streams O
are O
crossed O
by O
steel O
and O
concrete O
bridges O
, O
and O
if O
overflows O
ever O
interfere O
with O
travel O
it O
is O
but O
for O
a O
few O
hours O
at O
a O
time. O
Affidavits O
of O
several O
pupils O
who O
lived O
outside O
the O
limits O
of O
district O
191 O
, O
east O
, O
southeast O
, O
south O
, O
west O
and O
northwest O
, O
some O
of O
them O
from O
points O
more O
remote O
from O
the O
school O
than O
any O
who O
lived O
in O
the O
district O
, O
stating O
they O
had O
attended O
high O
school O
in O
Greenfield O
from O
one O
to O
three O
years O
and O
that O
their O
attendance O
had O
not O
been O
at O
any O
time O
prevented O
by O
the O
condition O
of O
the O
roads O
and O
that O
they O
attended O
regularly O
, O
were O
corroborated O
by O
a O
teacher O
. O
It O
is O
evident O
no O
school O
district O
can O
be O
organized O
so O
that O
every O
pupil O
in O
it O
will O
be O
as O
conveniently O
located O
with O
reference O
to O
the O
school O
house O
as O
every O
other O
pupil. O
What O
is O
required O
in O
the O
organization O
of O
school O
districts O
is O
that O
all O
the O
children O
within O
its O
boundaries O
shall O
be O
offered O
an O
opportunity O
to O
enjoy O
, O
with O
a O
reasonable O
degree O
of O
comfort O
, O
the O
benefits O
of O
the O
school. O
We O
have O
discussed O
this O
question O
so O
often O
that O
we O
deem O
it O
unnecessary O
to O
do O
more O
here O
than O
refer O
to O
some O
of O
the O
cases. O
Many O
of O
them O
will O
be O

We O
can O
not O
say O
the O

erred O
in O
dismissing O
the O
information O
. O
To O
our O
minds O
there O
is O
very O
little O
merit O
in O
the O
contention O
that O
the O
district O
is O
illegal O

it O
embraces O
parts O

more O
than O
one O

Bergman\u2019s O
sister O

Maude O

, O
was O
informed O
that O
something O
might O
be O
done O
in O

of O
her O
brother O
if O
someone O
could O
interest O
the O

She O
was O
informed O
that O
Rosenbaum O
could O
do O
something O
through O

with O
the O

, O
and O
she O
went O
to O
the O
city O
hall O

to O
see O
him. O
She O
did O
not O
know O
Rosenbaum O
and O
had O
a O
bailiff O
call O
him O
out. O
She O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
could O
help O
her O
brother O
out; O
that O
he O
had O
got O
from O
one O
to O
ten O

He O
asked O
her O
what O
judge O
he O
was O
brought O
before O
, O
and O
she O
told O
him O
Judge O
Caverly O
, O
and O
he O
said: O
\u201cWell O
, O
I O
will O
be O
fixed O
fine O
in O
that O
case; O
I O
am O
a O
good O

He O
said O
he O
would O
take O

she O
should O
meet O
him O
at O
the O

She O
told O

she O
would O
be O
unable O
to O
come O
but O
arranged O
for O
him O
to O
call O
her O
up O
by O
telephone. O
He O
called O
her O
up O
in O
the O
evening O
and O
said O
everything O
looked O
fine; O
that O
he O
was O
having O
lunch O
with O
Hinky O
Dink O
, O
his O
personal O
friend O
, O
and O
Hinky O
Dink O
said O
everything O
looked O
fine O
but O
she O
should O
not O
get O
too O
joyful O
over O
it O
, O
and O
he O
would O
let O
her O
know O
in O
the O
morning. O
He O
called O
her O
the O
next O
morning O
and O
told O
her O
everything O
was O
fixed; O
that O
his O
friend O
Hinky O
Dink O
saw O
the O
judge O
and O
said O
everything O

it O
would O

Rosenbaum O
on O
January O

He O
then O
said O
he O
was O
going O
to O
have O
a O
little O
party O
between O
Hinky O
Dink O
, O
Judge O
Caverly O
and O
himself O
and O
he O
would O
be O
introduced O
to O
Judge O
*332.Caverly O
through O
Hinky O
Dink O
, O
and O
they O
were O
going O
to O
have O
a O
liquor O
party O
, O
\u2014 O
a O
case O
of O

, O
\u2014 O
and O
he O
was O
going O
to O
get O
her O
brother O
either O
one O
year O
in O
the O
house O
of O
correction O
or O
probation. O
On O
February O
6 O
, O
1923 O
, O
she O
met O
Rosenbaum O
in O
Judge O
Hebei\u2019s O
court O
, O
and O
he O
told O
her O
that O
prosecutor O
Smith O
was O
absent O
and O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
do O
anything O
for O
her O
that O
day O
, O
and O
that O
he O
was O
double-crossed O
and O
would O
have O
to O
return O
her O
money. O
He O
called O
her O
up O
by O
telephone O
that O
night O
and O
said O
that O
he O
had O
been O
double-crossed O
and O
would O
show O
up O
the O
people O
who O
had O
double-crossed O
him O
and O
would O
give O
her O
her O
money. O

, O
\u201d O
and O
Mrs. O
Olson O
went O
to O
see O
him. O
She O
then O
saw O
Judge O
Caverly O
, O
who O
also O
talked O
with O
alderman O
Kenna O
and O
then O
took O
Mrs. O
Olson O
before O
the O
grand O

, O
and O
Rosenbaum O
was O
indicted. O
Every O
statement O

in O
any O
manner O
to O
Judge O
Caverly O
or O

Kenna O
or O
a O

party O
was O
false O
. O
The O
argument O
for O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
is O
under O
two O
heads: O
First O
, O
that O
the O
crime O
was O
obtaining O
money O
by O
false O
pretenses; O
and O
second O
, O
that O
the O
court O
gave O
the O
jury O
section O
98 O
of O
division O
1 O
of O
the O
Criminal O
Code O
, O
defining O
the O
confidence O
game O
. O
There O
was O
no O
denial O
of O
the* O
facts O
above O
stated O
and O
they O
constituted O
the O
offense O
of O
the O
confidence O
game O
, O
which O
consists O
in O
gaining O
possession O
of O
money O
or O
property O
by O
some O
trick O
or O
device O
or O
any O
swindling O
operation O
by O
which O
advantage O
is O
taken O
of O
the O
confidence O
which O
the O
victim O
has O
reposed O
in O

The O
objection O
to O
the O
instruction O
is O
that O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
on O
which O
to O
base O
it O
, O
and O
the O
facts O
stated O
show O
that O
the O
objection O
is O
without O
any O
reasonable O
foundation. O
Plaintiff O
in O
error O
obtained O
the O
confidence O
of O
Mrs. O
Olson O
by O
false O
representations O
that O
he O
would O
be O
fixed O
fine O
in O
the O
case; O
that O
he O
was O
a O
good O
friend O
of O
Hinky O

, O
and O
afterward O
that O
*333everything O
was O
fixed; O
that O
Hinky O
Dink O
had O
seen O
the O
judge O
and O
everything O
was O
fixed O
fine; O
that O
he O
was O
going O
to O
have O
a O
little O
party O
between O
Hinky O
Dink O
, O
Judge O
Caverly O
and O
himself O
and O
would O
secure O
imprisonment O
in O
the O
house O
of O
correction O
or O
admission O
to O
probation. O
It O
was O
because O
of O
that O
confidence O
that O
she O
gave O
him O
$120. O
His O
preference O
that O
he O
should O
be O

as O
a O

who O
was O

was O
in O

at O

His O

On O
petition O
of O
Della O

, O
Charles O

was O

On O

, O
1922 O
, O
L. O
Grant O
Lundberg O
, O
public O
administrator O
of O
Ford O

, O
filed O
a O
petition O
in O
the O

praying O
that O
as O
public O

he O
be O
appointed O
administrator O
of O

and O
that O
the O
appointment O
of O

be O

Attached O
to O

was O
the O
request O
of O
Minnie O

for O
the O
appointment O
of O
the O
public O

as O

The O
county O
court O
denied O
the O
petition O
and O
the O
petitioner O
appealed O
to O
the O
circuit O
court O
, O
which O
also O
denied O
the O
petition. O
The O
Appellate O
Court O
affirmed O
the O
judgment O

the O

, O
and O
a O
writ O
of O
certiorari O
was O
allowed O
to O
bring O
the O
record O
before O
this O
court O
for O
review O
. O
The O
facts O
were O
stipulated O
, O
and O
the O
only O
question O
for O
determination O
is O
whether O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
as O
public O
administrator O
, O
has O
the O
right O
, O
under O
the O

the O
defendant O

section O

of O

, O
the O

thereby O
approving O

This O

In O
Board O
of O
Education O
v. O
Board O
of O
Education O
, O
308 O
Ill. O
231 O
, O
we O
held O
that O
this O
statute O
must O
be O
construed O
so O
that O
it O
will O
apply O
alike O
to O
all O
high O
school O
districts O
in O
the O
State. O
If O
the O
legislature O
had O
intended O
that O
the O
pupil O
should O
procure O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
the O
county O
in O
which O
such O
pupil O
resides O
, O
and O
no O
other O
, O
it O
would O
have O
said O
so. O
Certainly O
this O
court O
has O
no O
authority O
to O
read O
into O
the O
act O
language O
that O
is O
not O
*33there. O
Whether O
the O
legislature O
has O
the O
power O
to O
give O
to O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
the O
county O
in O
which O
is O
located O
the O
district O
to O
be O
charged O
with O
the O
tuition O
, O
the O
authority O
to O
grant O
the O
certificate O
of O
convenience O
required O
, O
without O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
the O
county O
where O
the O
school O
to O
be O
attended O
is O
located O
we O
need O
not O
decide O
, O
because O
the O
legislature O
has O
not O
attempted O
to O
grant O
such O
authority. O
As O
we O
said O
in O
the O
case O
cited O
, O
where O
the O
two O
districts O
involved O
lie O
in O
more O
than O
one O
county O
the O
pupil O
must O
have O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendents O
of O
all O
counties O
involved O
before O
he O
may O
attend O
a O
high O
school O
in O
a O
district O
other O
than O
the O
one O
in O
which O
he O
resides O
, O
at O
the O
expense O
of O
his O
district. O
For O
that O
reason O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
holding O
that O
it O
was O
not O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
approval O
of O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
of O
Macon O
county. O
For O
want O
of O
such O
approval O
the O
Stonington O
district O
was O
not O
liable O
for O
the O
tuition O
involved O
, O
and O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
entering O
judgment O
against O
it O
. O
Appellant O
argues O
that O
section O
96 O
\u201cis O
unconstitutional O
in O
so O
far O
as O
it O
purports O
to O
create O
liability O
upon O
one O
high O
school O
district O
without O
its O
consent O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
paying O
for O
the O
tuition O
of O
its O
pupils O
in O
another O
district O
, O
and O
for O
the O
additional O
reason O
that O
the O
county O
superintendent O
of O
schools O
, O
being O
an O
administrative O
officer O
, O
could O
not O
properly O
be O
one O
who O
could O
decide O
or O
fix O
that O
liability O
, O
and O
because O
it O
is O
a O
violation O
of O
the O
due O
process O
clause O
to O
fix O
liability O
upon O
the O
district O
without O
giving O
it O
a O
chance O

heard.\u201d O
Having O
found O
that O

a O
judgment O

the O
constitutional O
questions O

About O

P. O
M. O
Albrecht O
met O
Wright O
in O
the O
entry O
and O
asked O
if O
he O
was O
going O
back O
into O
his O
room O
again O
, O
and O
when O
Wright O
replied O
that O
he O
was O
not O
, O
Albrecht O
said O
, O
\u201cAll O
right O
, O
\u201d O
and O
started O
toward O
the O
cross-cut O
where O
he O
was O
working. O
When O
he O
was O
near O
the O
mouth O
of O
the O
cross-cut O
he O
called O
to O
his O
buddy O
and O
said O
, O
\u201cAll O
right O
, O
Jake; O
light O
up.\u201d O
Albrecht O
and O
his O
buddy O
had O
placed O
a O
single O
shot O
in O
the O
left-hand O
corner O
of O
the O
cross-cut O
and O
had O
inserted O
a O
five-foot O
fuse. O
Stehle O
lighted O
this O
fuse O
and O
walked O
out O
of O
the O
cross-cut O
and O
met O
Albrecht O
in O
the O
entry. O
Albrecht O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
had O
lighted O
the O
fuse. O
The O
latter O
replied O
that O
he O
had O
, O
and O
walked O
down O
the O
entry O
to O
get O
his O
coat O
and O
dinner O
bucket. O
When O
Stehle O
left O
Albrecht O
the O
latter O
was O
standing O
in O
the O
entry O
with O
his O
coat O
and O
hat O
on O
, O
his O
dinner O
pail O
in O
his O
hand O
and O
his O
pipe O
in O
his O
mouth. O
About O
five O
or O
six O
minutes O
after O
Stehle O
lighted O
the O
fuse O
he O
heard O
the O
report O
of O
the O
shot. O
When O
he O
came O
through O
the O
entry O
on O
the O
way O
out O
he O
could O
not O
find O
his O
buddy O
and O
reported O
to O
Wright. O
The O
latter O
and O
Stehle O
went O
into O
the O
cross-cut O
and O
found O
Albrecht\u2019s O
body O
lying O
about O
twenty O
feet O
from O
the O
point O
where O
the O
shot O
had O
been O
placed. O
His. O
head O
was O
.blown O
off O
, O
and O
scattered O
about O
the O
body O
were O
his O
cap O
and O
pieces. O
of O
his O
pipe O
and O
dinner O
pail O
. O
The O
circuit O
court O
set O
aside O
the O
award O
of O
the O
Industrial O
Commission O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
\u201cWilliam O
Albrecht O
died O
as O
the O
result O
of O
injuries O
willfully O
, O
deliberately O
and O
intentionally O
inflicted O
upon O
himself O
by O
his O
own O
act O
, O
with O
willful O
and O
deliberate O
intent O
to O
commit O
suicide.\u201d O
There O
is O
not O
a O
scintilla O
of O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
to O
justify O
such O
a O
conclusion. O
All. O
the O
evidence O
shows O
that O
Albrecht O
was O
engaged O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
his O
duties O
at O
the O
time O
he O
was O
killed O
and O
that O
his O
death O
resulted O
from O
injuries O
arising O
out O
of O
his O
employment. O
No O
one O
knows O
why O
he O
went O
back O
into O
the O
cross-cut O
after O
his O
buddy O
had O
lighted O
the O
fuse O
, O
but O
the O
natural O
conclusion O
is O
that O
he O
concluded O
that O
the O
fuse O
was O
not O
burning O
and O
went O
back O
to O
re-light O
it. O
While O
this O
was O
not O
the O
wise O
*325thing O
for O
him O
to O
do O
, O
such O
an O
act O
did O
not O
take O
him O
out O

A O

on O

Thereupon O

The O
origi*563nal O

had O
not O
sufficient O
mental O
capacity O

that O
he O
had O
before O
that O

been O

times O
adjudged O

and O
confined O
in O
an O
insane O
asylum; O
that O
his O

insanity; O
that O
he O
was O
affected O
with O
a O
disease O
, O
practiced O
bad O
habits O
, O
and O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death O
was O
insane O
and O
mentally O
incapable O
of O
understanding O
a O

was O
in O

, O
Iva O
Orf O
, O
the O
lawful O
wife O
of O
Tony O
Orf O
, O
for O
the O
fraudulent O
purpose O
of O
obtaining O
Feyerabend\u2019s O
property O
, O
induced O
him O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
marriage O
contract O
with O
her O
, O
and O
while O
she O
was O
the O
lawful O
wife O
of O
Tony O
Orf O
caused O
Feyerabend O
to O
introduce O
her O
to O
acquaintances O
as O
Miss O
Walker O
, O
his O
future O
wife; O
*564that O
thereafter O
, O
in O
pursuance O
of O
her O
fraudulent O
design O
and O
purpose O
, O
and O
while O
Feyerabend O
was O
without O
mental O
capacity O
to O
enter O
into O
the O
marriage O
relation O
, O
she O
induced O
him O
, O
on O
the O
25th O
of O
June O
, O
1920 O
, O
to O
go O
through O
the O
form O
of O
a O
marriage O
ceremony O
in O
the O
State O
of O
Missouri O
two O
days O
after O
she O
had O
secured O
a O
divorce O
from O
her O
husband O
, O
Tony; O
that O
Feyerabend O
before O
, O
at O
the O
time O
of O
and O
up O
to O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death O
remained O
insane O
, O
without O
capacity O
to O
enter O
into O
a O
marriage O
contract O
or O
relation; O
that O
he O
never O
at O
any O
time O
after O
the O
alleged O
marriage O
had O
the O
mental O
capacity O
to O
ratify O
or O
dis-affirm O
it. O
The O
court O
finds O
the O
marriage O
between O
Iva O
Orf O
and O
Feyerabend O
was O
illegal O
and O
void O
because O
at O
the O
time O
of O
its O
performance O
Feyerabend O
was O
insane O
, O
and O
that O
Iva O
had O
no O
right O
, O
title O
or O
interest O
in O
the O
real O
estate O
of O
Feyerabend. O
The O
court O
further O
finds O
that O
Iva O
, O
on O
or O
about O
January O
25 O
, O
1921 O
, O
pretended O
she O
had O
given O
birth O
to O
a O
child O
by O
Feyerabend O
as O
the O
issue O
of O
their O
marriage O
, O
and O
finds O
that O
said O
child O
was O
not O
the O
child O
of O
either O
Iva O
or O
Feyerabend O
but O
was O
the O
child O
of O
a O
person O
other O
than O
Iva O
, O
and O
was O
taken O
by O
her O
with O
the O
fraudulent O
design O
and O
purpose O
of O
inducing O
Feyerabend O
to O
believe O
he O
was O
the O
father O
of O
the O
child O
, O
and O
that O
he O
did O
not O
have O
sufficient O
mental O
capacity O
to O
discover O
the O
fraud O
practiced O
on O
him. O
The O
decree O
adjudges O
that O
George O
L. O
Feyerabend O
, O
Jr. O
, O
is O
not O
the O
lawful O
child O
of O
Feyerabend O
nor O
of O
Iva O
and O
is O
not O
an O
heir O
of O
Feyerabend O
, O
and O
has O
no O
right O
, O
title O
or O
interest O
in O
the O
lands O
of O
which O
he O
died O
seized O
. O
The O
sole O
question O
presented O
by O
this O
appeal O
for O
decision O
is O
whether O
the O
facts O
found O
in O
the O
decree O
are O
sufficient O
to O
sustain O
it. O
It O
is O
not O
, O
and O
could O
not O
be O
, O
contended O
by O
appellant O
that O
the O
recitals O
of O
the O
decree O
are O
mere O
conclusions O
of O
the O
chancellor O
and O
not O
facts. O
An O
ultimate O
fact O
necessary O
to O
be O
determined O
in O
the O
case O
was O
whether O
the O
alleged O
marriage O
between O
Iva O
Orf O
and O
George O
L. O
Feyerabend O
was O
a O
valid O
marriage. O
Appellees O
allege O
it O
was O
invalid O
because O
*565Feyerabend O
was O
insane O
at O
the O
time O
the O
marriage O
contract O
was O
made O
and O
the O
ceremony O
performed O
and O
was O
incapable O
of O
comprehending O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
contract O
and O
the O
marriage. O
The O
court O
found O
the O
fact O
to O
be O
that O
he O
was O
insane O
, O
incapable O
of O
comprehending O
the O
nature O
of O
his O
act O
, O
and O
that O
the O
marriage O
was O
null O
and O
void. O
That O
was O
the O
ultimate O
fact O
in O
controversy O
and O
was O
sufficient O
to O
sustain O
the O
decree O
upon O
that O
issue. O
It O
is O
not O
the O
recital O
of O
a O
conclusion O
, O
such O
as O
is O
sometimes O
made O
, O
that O
the O
complainant O
has O
proved O
the O
allegations O
of O
his O
bill O
and O
the O
equities O
are O
with O
him O
and O
a O
decree O
is O
entered O
accordingly. O
On O
the O
question O
of O
the O
parentage O
of O
the O
child O
, O
appellant O
by O
her O
answer O
admitted O
it O
was O
not O
the O
issue O
of O
the O
alleged O
marriage O
. O
It O
is O
contended O
the O
decree O
does O
not O
recite O
that O
the O
findings O
of O
facts O
made O
therein O
are O
based O
on O
the O
evidence. O
We O
do O
not O
tlynk O
this O
position O
of O
appellant O
is O
tenable. O
It O
is O
true O
that O
the O
findings O
are O
not O
all O
preceded O
by O
the O
statement O
that O
the O
court O
found O
from O
the O
evidence O
the O
facts O
recited O
in O
the O
decree O
, O
but O
in O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
decree O
it O
states O
the O
cause O
was O
heard O
by O
the O
court O
on O
oral O
and O
documentary O
evidence O
produced O
and O
then O
proceeds O
to O
find O
the O
facts. O
It O
was O
not O
required O
that O
each O
sentence O
or O
paragraph O
of O
the O
findings O
should O
be O
preceded O
by O
a O
statement O
that O
they O
were O
found O
from O
the O
evidence. O
The O
only O
reasonable O
meaning O
of O
the O
decree O
is O
that O
the O
facts O
found O
in O
it O
were O
found O
from O
the O
evidence O
heard O
by O
the O
court O
, O
which O
the O
decree O
shows O
was O
produced O
in O
open O
court O
before O
the O
chancellor O
. O
We O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
certificate O
of O
evidence O
the O
decree O
must O
be O
sustained O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
it O
recites O
facts O

date O
of O
the O
homicide O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
had O
been O
living O
at O
the O
home O
of O
Louise O
Shaw O
, O
in O
the O
city O
of O
East O
St. O
Louis O
, O
with O
a O
woman O
known O
in O
the O
record O
both O
as O
Mrs. O
Burney O
and O
Eva O
Johnson. O
The O
deceased O
, O
Burney O
, O
was O
in O
the O
government O
service O
as O
a O
soldier O
in O
the O
world O
war. O
Prior O
to O
his O
going O
into O
the O
service O
he O
had O
lived O
with O
Eva O
Johnson O
, O
during O
which O
time O
she O
was O
apparently O
known O
as O
Mrs. O
Burney. O
Burney O
returned O
to O
East O
St. O
Louis O
on O
a O
furlough O
, O
and O
on O
the O
9th O
of O
March O
, O
1919 O
, O
came O
to O
the O
home O
of O
Louise O
Shaw O
to O
see O
the O
Johnson O
woman. O
The O
next O
day O
she O
left O
the O
home O
of O
Louise O
Shaw. O
On O
the O
nth O
of O
March O
she O
returned O
and O
took O
away O
some O
of O
her O
clothing. O
Shortly O
after O
she O
had O
been O
in O
the O
Shaw O
home O
on O
that O
day O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
came O
to O
the O
Shaw O
house O
and O
shortly O
thereafter O
the O
deceased O
also O
arrived O
there. O
As O
to O
what O
occurred O
there O
the O
record O
contains O
only O
the O
testimony O
of O
Louise O
Shaw O
and O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
According O
to O
the O
former\u2019s O
testimony O
, O
when O
the O
deceased O
came O
to O
the O
door O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
answered O
it O
and O
returned O
to O
her O
and O
told O
her O
that O
it O
was O
Burney. O
Upon O
being O
told O
by O
her O
to O
let O
Burney O
in O
, O
he O
returned O
to O
the O
door O
and O
opened O
it. O
Burney O
proceeded O
through O
the O
house O
to O
the O
kitchen O
, O
and O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
went O
into O
the O
front O
room O
, O
got O
his O
revolver O
and O
followed O
Burney O
into O
the O
kitchen. O
According O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
there O
was O
no O
argument O
between O
the O
two O
men O
until O
Burney O
was O
about O
to O
leave O
and O
had O
told O
her O
good-by O
, O
as O
he O
was O
going O
back O
into O
the O
service; O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
then O
said O
to O
him O
, O
\u201cDidn\u2019t O
you O
say O
you O
were O
going O
to O
kill O
me O
if O
you O
ever O
got O
back O
over?\u201d O
to O
which O
Burney O
replied O
, O
\u201cNo; O
I O
am O
too O
intellect;\u201d O
that O
Jones O
then O
stepped O
forward O
and O
fired O
four O
shots; O
that O
Burney O
, O
who O
was O
leaning O
against O
the O
door O
, O
seemed O
to O
be O
slipping O
to O
the O
floor O
after O
the O
first O
shot; O
that O
he O
reached O
inside O
his O
coat O
and O
drew O
his O
revolver O
and O
fired O
at O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
and O
as O
he O
fell O
to O
the O
floor O
he O
fired O
again O
, O
*193sending O
the O
bullet O
into O
the O
floor; O
that O
after O
he O
had O
fallen O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
stooped O
over O
him O
and O
snapped O
his O
pistol O
at O
him O
again O
several O
times O
but O
it O
did O
not O
fire. O
It O
appears O
from O
the O
evidence O
that O
the O
shot O
fired O
by O
Burney O
toward O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
struck O
him O
in O
the O
upper O
arm O
, O
went O
through O
the O
wall O
behind O
him O
and O
passing O
through O
the O
next O
room O
lodged O
in O
the O
opposite O
wall. O
The O
State O
also O
introduced O
evidence O
showing O
that O
this O
bullet O
entered O
the O
wall O
behind O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
53inches O
from O
the O
floor; O
that O
the O
point O
where O
it O
lodged O
in O
the O
opposite O
wall O
of O
the O
adjoining O
room O
was O
59 O
inches O
above O
the O
floor O
, O
indicating O
that O
the O
ball O
from O
the O
point O
of O
entry O
into O
the O
first O
wall O
to O
the O
point O
where O
it O
lodged O
in O
the O
opposite O
wall O
of O
the O
adjoining O
room O
had O
taken O
an O
upward O
course O
. O
Louise O
Shaw O
was O
the O
only O
witness O
to O
the O
alleged O
crime. O
There O
is O
nothing O
in O
the O
record O
to O
indicate O
that O
she O
had O
any O
interest O
in O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
suit O
or O
that O
she O
had O
any O
unfriendly O
feeling O
against O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
Plaintiff O
in O
error O
, O
who O
testified O
in O
his O
own O
behalf O
, O
does O
not O
say O
that O
any O
such O
feeling O
existed O
on O
her O
part O
or O
that O
they O
had O
ever O
had O
any O
trouble. O
It O
appears O
that O
he O
was O
then O
, O
and O
had O
been O
for O
some O
months O
, O
rooming O
at O
her O
house. O
It O
also O
appears O
from O
the O
testimony O
of O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
had O
known O
that O
the O
deceased O
and O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
had O
been O
living O
together O
in O
a O
state O
of O
adultery O
and O
that O
there O
had O
been O
frequent O
arguments O
between O
her O
and O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
about O
the O
matter; O
that O
on O
one O
occasion O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
drew O
a O
gun O
on O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
and O
demanded O
money O
which O
she O
said O
she O
had O
saved O
up O
to O
buy O
civilian O
clothes O
for O
the O
deceased O
when O
he O
came O
back O
from O
the O
war. O
It O
is O
also O
apparent O
from O
the O
testimony O
that O
while O
Burney O
and O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
were O
not O
acquainted O
, O
the O
latter O
knew O
that O
Burney O
was O
in O
the O
army O
service O
and O
that O
he O
was O
home O
on O
a O
furlough O
. O
Plaintiff O
in O
error O
took O
the O
stand O
and O
stated O
that O
he O
shot O
in O
self-defense; O
that O
in O
the O
kitchen O
of O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
*194Burney O
at O
all O
times O
kept O
his O
hand O
in O
his O
overcoat O
pocket; O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
said O
to O
him O
, O
\u201cWhy O
do O
you O
want O
to O
kill O
me? O
I O
wouldn\u2019t O
hurt O
a O
hair O
in O
your O
head;\u201d O
that O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
made O
some O
remark O
, O
and O
as O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
turned O
to O
her O
, O
Burney O
, O
without O
warning O
, O
pulled O
his O
gun O
from O
his O
overcoat O
pocket O
and O
fired O
at O
plaintiff O
in O
error; O
that O
they O
were O
about O
ten O
feet O
apart O
at O
that O
time; O
that O
the O
bullet O
fired O
by O
Burney O
entered O
the O
inside O
of O
plaintiff O
in O
error\u2019s O
arm O
above O
his O
elbow O
and O
passed O
through O
the O
arm O
and O
a O
portion O
of O
his O
side O
and O
through O
the O
wall O
of O
the O
kitchen; O
that O
after O
he O
was O
shot O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
drew O
his O
gun O
and O
fired O
at O
Burney O
, O
the O
bullet O
striking O
him O
in O
the O
left O
breast; O
that O
as O
Burney O
fell O
he O
fired O
again O
, O
the O
bullet O
going O
into O
the O
floor; O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
shortly O
thereafter O
left O
the O
house O
and O
went O
to O
St. O
Louis; O
that O
the O
next O
day O
he O
came O
back O
to O
the O
police O
station O
and O
surrendered O
. O
It O
is O
contended O
that O
the O
verdict O
is O
not O
supported O
by O
the O
evidence; O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
admitting O
improper O
evidence O
on O
the O
part O
of O
the O
People O
and O
in O
excluding O
competent O
evidence O
offered O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
defense; O
also O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
the. O
instructions O
. O
The O
evidence O
detailed O
here O
is O
all O
that O
the O
record O
contains O
, O
aside O
from O
that O
of O
the O
post-mortem O
examination O
showing O
cause O
of O
death O
and O
the O
testimony O
of O
character O
witnesses O
for O
the O
defendant. O
Whether O
the O
killing O
was O
murder O
or O
was O
in O
self-defense O
was O
a O
question O
for O
the O
jury. O
They O
have O
decided O
that O
issue O
against O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
The O
testimony O
of O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
was O
direct O
and O
positive O
, O
and O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
any O
ill-feeling O
on O
her O
part O
toward O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
The O
fact O
that O
the O
bullet O
fired O
by O
Burney O
took O
an O
upward O
course O
and O
struck O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
above O
the O
elbow O
corroborates O
the O
statement O
of O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
that O
Burney O
fired O
as O
he O
was O
falling. O
The O
record O
contains O
no O
reason O
for O
taking O
the O
view O
that O
the O
evidence O
does O
not O
sustain O
the O
verdict O
. O
*195It O
is O
urged O
that O
it O
was O
error O
for O
the O
court O
to O
permit O
the O
State O
to O
show O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
and O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
were O
living O
at O
the O
Shaw O
home O
as O
man O
and O
wife; O
that O
such O
testimony O
was O
not O
material O
and O
tended O
to O
prejudice O
the O
jury; O
also O
that O
it O
was O
error O
to O
permit O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
to O
testify O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
said O
to O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
two O
days O
before O
the O
shooting O
, O
\u201cYou O
won\u2019t O
live O
with O
Burney O
here O
or O
nowhere O
else O
, O
\u201d O
and O
that O
it O
was O
error O
to O
permit O
the O
State O
to O
show O
by O
the O
Shaw O
woman O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
had O
drawn O
a O
gun O
on O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
and O
made O
her O
give O
him O
money O
which O
she O
said O
she O
was O
saving O
for O
Burney. O
The O
argument O
is O
that O
such O
testimony O
might O
be O
material O
if O
he O
was O
charged O
with O
killing O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
but O
not O
on O
the O
charge O
of O
killing O
Burney. O
The O
testimony O
of O
his O
statements O
was O
clearly O
competent O
as O
showing O
the O
motive O
for O
the O
killing O
of O
Burney. O
It O
tends O
to O
establish O
jealousy O
on O
the O
part O
of O
plaintiff O
in O
error. O
He O
and O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
had O
been O
living O
together O
prior O
to O
the O
return O
of O
the O
deceased. O
After O
Burney O
went O
to O
war O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
and O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
began O
living O
together O
in O
the O
home O
of O
Louise O
Shaw O
, O
and O
the O
testimony O
shows O
they O
had O
sustained O
that O
relation O
until O
the O
day O
prior O
to O
the O
shooting. O
Under O
the O
record O
in O
this O
case O
the O
threats O
of O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
to O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
were O
competent O
, O
not O
as O
threats O
against O
her O
but O
as O
tending O
to O
show O
the O
relations O
of O
the O
parties O
and O
the O
motive O
for O
the O
killing. O
It O
was O
error O
to O
admit O
testimony O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
took O
money O
from O
her O
by O
use O
of O
a O
gun O
, O
as O
it O
tended O
to O
establish O
a O
separate O
offense O
, O
but O
we O
are O
of O
the O
opinion O
that O
under O
the O
facts O
as O
shown O
by O
the O
record O
such O
error O
is O
not O
sufficient O
to O
reverse O
the O
judgment O
. O
The O
evidence O
excluded O
by O
the O
court O
which O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
contends O
was O
competent O
concerned O
the O
contents O
of O
certain O
letters O
said O
to O
have O
been O
written O
by O
Burney O
to O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
, O
in O
which O
it O
was O
intimated O
that O
he O
intended O
to O
kill O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
when O
he O
got O
back O
home. O
It O
was O
*196not O
shown O
that O
plaintiff O
in O
error O
made O
any O
effort O
to O
procure O
these O
letters. O
The O
only O
attempt O
to O
lay O
a O
foundation O
for O
introducing O
secondary O
proof O
of O
their O
contents O
was O
the O
statement O
that O
the O
government O
at O
that O
time O
had O
possession O
of O
the O
letters O
, O
apparently O
under O
a O
charge O
then O
pending O
against O
the O
Johnson O
woman O
of O
an O
illegal O
claim O
for O
Burney\u2019s O
allotment. O
In O
the O
absence O
of O
a O
showing O
of O
diligence O
in O
an O
endeavor O
to O
obtain O
the O
letters O
themselves O
, O
sufficient O
foundation O
was O
not O
laid O
for O
secondary O
evidence O
as O
to O
their O
contents O
and O
such O
evidence O
was O
properly O
rejected O
. O
It O
is O
contended O
that O
the O
twentieth O
instruction O
given O
for O
the O
People O
was O
erroneous. O
That O
instruction O
is O
as O
follows: O
\u201cThe O
court O
further O
instructs O
you O
that O
if O
you O
believe O
from O

that O
any O
person O
who O

has O
sworn O
falsely O
as O
to O
any O

then O
you O

as O
you O
may O
find O
it O
corroborated O
by O
other O
credible O
evidence O
given O
before O
you O
in O
this O
case.\u201d O
This O
instruction O

that O
it O

should O

Considering O
the O
instructions O
as O
a O
series O
, O
however O
, O
we O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
under O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case O
the O
error O
was O
not O
sufficient O
to O

a O
reversal O
of O

Instruction O
No. O
17 O

in O

Mr. B-A
Justice I-A

delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Freeman O
Ralph O
, O
Mike O
David O
Jennings O
and O
Walter O
Gaines O
, O
a O
colored O
man O
, O
were O
convicted O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Jasper O
county O
of O
burglary O
and O
larceny. O
Defendants O
Ralph O
and O
Jennings O
were O
each O
seventeen O
years O
old O
and O
Gaines O
nineteen. O
They O
rode O
in O
box-cars O
of O
freight O
trains O
from O
Evansville O
, O
Indiana O
, O
to O
Newton O
, O
Jasper O
county O
, O
Illinois O
, O
arriving O
in O
Newton O
the O
afternoon O
of O
July O
9 O
, O
1923. O
The O
freight O
train O
they O
were O
on O
stopped O
a O
considerable O
time O
at O
Newton O
, O
and O
while O
it O
was O
there O
the O
residence O
of O
Robert O
and O
Ethel O
Thompson O
, O
about O
a O
hundred O
yards O
from O
the O
railroad O
track O
, O
was O
burglarized O
and O
four O
or O
five O
shirts O
, O
a O
pair O
of O
men\u2019s O
shoes O
, O
a O
flashlight O
, O
a O
razor O
and O
a O
pie O
were O
stolen. O
Two O
of O
defendants O
were O
seen O
running O
from O
the O
house O
to O
the O
railroad O
, O
and O
they O
were O
seen O
in O
a O
box-car. O
They O
were O
in O
the O
car O
when O
the O
train O
pulled O
out O
for O
the O
north O
, O
and O
when O
it O
arrived O
at O
Toledo O
, O
some O
twenty-five O
miles O
north O
of O
Newton O
, O
they O
were O
arrested O
by O
the O
sheriff O
of O
Cumberland O
county O
and O
placed O
in O
jail. O
' O
The O
stolen O
property O
, O
except O
the O
pie O
, O
was O
found O
hidden O
in O
the O
jail. O
Jennings O
had O
a O
suit-case O
, O
and O
it O
is O
evident O
the O
property O
was O
taken O
from O
the O
suit-case O
and O
hidden. O
When O
the O
case O
came O
on O
for O
trial O
Ralph O
pleaded O
*608guilty O
, O
testified O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
People O
and O
told O
his O
story O
of O
the O
burglary. O
Jennings O
and O
Gaines O
, O
who O
pleaded O
not O
guilty O
, O
also O
testified O
in O
their O
own O
defense O
but O
were O
found O
guilty O
, O
and O
they O
have O
sued O
out O
this O
writ O
of O
error O
. O
The O
proof O
clearly O
warranted O
the O
verdict O
as O
to O
Jennings O
, O
but O
there O
is O
some O
question O
whether O
Gaines O
knew O
of O
the O
intended O
burglary O
before O
its O
commission O
and O
assented O
to O
it. O
and O
was O
therefore O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact O
and O
guilty O
as O
principal. O
When O
the O
train O
defendants O
were O
on O
stopped O
in O
Newton O
, O
Gaines O
, O
according O
to O
the O
testimony O
of O
his O
co-defendants O
, O
complained O
of O
being O
thirsty. O
He O
did O
not O
want O
to O
leave O
the O
car O
to O
get O
water O
as O
there O
were O
no O
colored O
people O
in O
Newton. O
Jennings O
and O
Ralph O
went O
to O
a O
house O
to O
get O
water O
for O
him. O
When O
they O
brought O
it O
to O
him O
Ralph O
said O
he O
was O
going O
to O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
, O
left O
the O
car O
and O
soon O
returned O
with O
a O
pie. O
Ralph O
testified O
there O
was O
no O
one O
at O
home O
when O
he O
got O
the O
pie O
, O
and O
that O
all O
three O
of O
them O
talked O
about O
going O
back O
to O
the O
house. O
He O
testified O
he O
and O
Jennings O
went O
back O
, O
entered O
the O
house O
and O
stole O
the O
property O
referred O
to. O
Jennings O
testified O
Ralph O
suggested O
going O
back O
to O
the O
house O
and O
stealing O
some O
clothes; O
that O
he O
went O
alone O
, O
but O
as O
he O
stayed O
a O
good O
while O
Jennings O
went O
to O
find O
him. O
He O
denied O
entering O
the O
house. O
Both O
testified O
they O
saw O
a O
woman O
near O
by O
and O
ran O
away O
and O
went O
back O
to O
the O
car. O
The O
woman O
came O
to O
the O
car O
where O
defendants O
were O
and O
asked O
for O
her O
pie-plate. O
They O
either O
made O
no O
reply O
or O
denied O
having O
it O
. O
In O
view O
of O
all O
the O
testimony O
in O
the O
record O
we O
cannot O
say O
the O
jury O
was O
not O
warranted O
in O
finding O
Jennings O
guilty. O
Ralph O
testified O
all O
three O
defendants O
talked O
about O
going O
back O
to O
the O
house O
where O
he O
got O
the O
pie O
, O
but O
that O
Gaines O
told O
them O
they O
had O
better O
not; O
that O
they O
would O
get O
into O
trouble O
if O
they O
did O
. O
Jennings O
testified O
Ralph O
asked O
him O
to O
go O
with O
him O
, O
but O
he O
refused O
, O
and O
did O
not O
testify O
to O
anything O
Gaines O
said O
or O
did. O
The O
question O
is O
raised O
whether O
the O
proof O
shows O
Gaines O
*609knew O
of O
and O
assented O
to O
the O
burglary O
before O
its O
commission O
and O
was O
therefore O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact O
, O
and O
whether O
his O
conviction O
, O
under O
the O
indictment O
, O
as O
principal O
can O
be O
sustained.. O
The O
proof O
shows O
Gaines O
did O
no O
act O
before O
its O
commission O
in O
aid O
of O
the O
burglary. O
It O
does O
tend O
to O
show O
that O
after O
its O
commission O
he O
aided O
in O
concealing O
the O
property. O
Counsel O
contend O
that O
at O
most O
Gaines O
was O
nothing O
more O
than O
an O
accessory O
after O
the O
fact O
, O
and O
that O
under O
the O
law O
he O
should O
not O
have O
been O
convicted O
under O
an O
indictment O
charging O
him O
as O
principal O
, O
and O
that O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
refusing O
instructions O
offered O
on O
the O
theory O
that O
the O
evidence O
did O
not O
justify O
a O
verdict O
of O
guilty O
against O
Gaines O
as O
principal. O

It O
appears O
from O
the O
record O
that O
the O
court O
adjourned O
for O
the O
noon O
hour O
after O
defendants\u2019 O
counsel O
had O
concluded O
his O
argument O
and O
that O
twelve O
instructions O
had O
been O
presented O
to O
the O
court O
for O
defendants O
before O
that O
time. O
None O
of O
them O
defined O
the O
difference O
between O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact O
and O
an O
accessory O
after O
the O
fact. O
The O
court O
instructed O
the O
jury O
, O
for O
the O
People O
, O
that O
all O
persons O
who O
are O
present O
and O
aid O
and O
abet O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
a O
crime O
are O
in O
law O
principals O
, O
and O
that O
if O
Gaines O
aided O
, O
abetted O
and O
assisted O
in O
the O
commission O
of O
the O
crime O
then O
he O
was O
guilty O
as O
an O
accessory. O
On O
the O
convening O
of O
court O
at O
1 O

P. O
M. O
, O
and O
before O
the O
State\u2019s O
attorney O
began O
the O
closing O
argument O
, O
'counsel O
for O
defendants O
requested O
the O
court O
to O
give O
on O
behalf O
of O
defendants O
three O
instructions O
defining O
what O
constitutes O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact O
and O
an O
accessory O
after O
the O
fact O
, O
and O
instructing O
the O
jury O
that O
if O
any O
one O
of O
the O
defendants O
was O
shown O
by O
the O
proof O
not O
to O
have O
been O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact O
such O
defendant O
could O
not O
be O
found O
guilty O
as O
principal. O
The O
court O
refused O
to O
give O
any O
of O
said O
instructions O
on O
the O
ground O
that O
they O
were O
not O
presented O
within O
the O
time O
provided O
by O
a O
rule O
of O
the O
court. O
The O
rule O
referred O
to O
provides O
that O
each O
party O
may O
present O
not O
more O
than O
ten O
in*610structions O
, O
and O
that O
they O
shall O
be O
presented O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
evidence O
\u201cand O
before O
the O
last O
argument O
begins.\u201d O
No O
additional O
instructions O
shall O
be O
presented O
except O
for O
good O
cause O
shown O
and O
by O
special O
permission O
of O
the O
court. O
The O
court O
has O
power O
to O
make O
rules O
regulating O
the O
presenting O
of O
instructions O
, O
but O
both O
the O
rule O
and O
the O
enforcement O
of O
it O
must O
be O
reasonable. O
Such O
a O
rule O
should O
never O
be O
enforced O
strictly O
when O
its O
enforcement O
would O
prejudice O
a O
defendant O
in O
having O
his O
case O
fairly O
presented O
to O
the O
jury. O
In O
the O
interest O
of O
the O
dispatch O
of O
business O
and O
to O
give O
the O
court O
an O
opportunity O
to O
examine O
and O
pass O
on O
instructions O
asked O
, O
a O
rule O
is O
not O
unreasonable O
which O
places O
some O
limit O
on O
the O
right O
to O
demand O
instructions O
, O
but O
the O
enforcement O
of O
any O
such O
rule O
must O
necessarily O
at O
times O
depend O
on O
the O
circumstances. O
Here O
the O
court O
refused O
to O
consider O
or O
give O
the O
three O
instructions O
because O
they O
had O
not O
been O
presented O
before O
the O
argument O
began O
at O
the O
conclusion O
of O
the O
evidence. O
Counsel O
for O
defendants O
had O
presented O
no O
instruction O
on O
the O
law O
covered O
by O
the O
three O
refused O
instructions O
, O
and O
they O
were O
necessary O
to O
properly O
present O
the O
law O
, O
under O
the O
evidence O
, O
as O
to O
the O
case O
of O
defendant O
Gaines. O
The O
proof O
was O
by O
no O
means O
clear O
that O
he O
was O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
under O
the O
statute O
, O
punishable O
as O
principal. O
If O
the O
proof O
showed O
he O
was O
guilty O
only O
as O
an O
accessory O
after O
the O
fact O
he O
was O
not O
subject O
to O
the O
same O
penalty O
as O
an O
accessory O
before O
the O
fact. O
(Smith\u2019s O
Stat. O

The O
instructions O
refused O
were O
not O
lengthy O
or O
complicated O
and O
there O
was O
sufficient O
time O
for O
the O
court O
to O
examine O
them O
before O
they O
were O
to O
be O
read O
to O
the O
jury. O
Under O
the O
circumstances O
we O
think O
the O
court O
should O
have O
relaxed O
the O
rule O
and O
that O
he O
erred O
in O
refusing O
to O
give O
an O
instruction O
on O
that O
point O
. O
The O
judgment O
will O

The O

a O

with O
the O
board O
of O

of O
Will O

claiming O
said O
property O
to O
be O

The O

dismissed O
the O

Thereupon O
the O

prayed O
an O

of O
the O
Revenue O
act O
of O
1898 O
, O
as O

in O

The O
property O
assessed O
is O
a O
trust O
fund O
of O
$30 O
, O

in O
notes O
and O
other O

established O
by O
the O

of O
John O

By O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
will O
the O
property O
is O
to O
be O
held O
intact O
by O
the O
trustees O
and O
the O
income O
therefrom O
is O
to O
be O
used O
as O
follows: O
Twenty-five O
dollars"a O
year O
to O
purchase O
new O
library O
books O
for O
the O
church O
, O
$50 O
a O

the O

of O
the O
organist O
of O
the O
church O
, O
and O
the O
remainder O
, O
yearly O
, O
to O
the O
minister O
of O
the O
church O
as O
part O
payment O
of O
his O
salary. O
The O
property O
has O
been O
owned O
and O
administered O
by O
the O
trustees O
in O
accordance O
with O
the O
terms O
of O
the O

for O
the O
past O
twelve O

The O
income O
from O
the O
property O
is O
about O
$1500 O
a O
year. O
The O
salary O
of O
the O
minister O
has O
been O
$2000 O
a O

The O

198 O
members O

owns O
its O
church O
building O
, O
which O
is O
located O
in O
Plainfield O

a O

of O
about O
1000 O

or O
used O
exclusively O
for O

or O
for O

and O
not O

or O
otherwise O

with O
a O
view O

The O
only O
question O
in O
this O
case O
is O
whether O
or O
not O
the O
property O
assessed O
is O
used O
exclusively O
for O
religious O
purposes. O
As O
we O
view O
the O
question O
the O
property O
is O
clearly O
exempt O
from O
taxation O
, O
and O
it O
is O
diEcult O
to O
perceive O
how O
a O
different O
conclusion O
could O
be O
reached. O
The O
property O
is O
to O
be O
owned O
and O
held O
intact O
exclusively O
for O
the O
purposes O
therein O
mentioned. O
It O
cannot O
be O
used O
otherwise O
under O
the O
terms O
of O
the O
will O
, O
and O
no O
other O
person O
can O
legally O
possess O
this O
*369property O
except O
the O
trustees O
and O
for O
the O
purposes O
aforesaid. O
It O
cannot O
be O
doubted O
that O
the O
church O
music O
furnished O
by O
the O
organist O
is O
part O
of O
the O
religious O
services O
and O
the O
Sunday O
school O
services O
conducted O
at O
that O
church. O
The O
organist O
is O
just O
as O
essential O
in O
furnishing O
that O
part O
of O
the O
religious O
services O
as O
is O
the O
organ O
itself. O
No O
one O
, O
certainly O
, O
would O
contend O
that O
the O
organ O
played O
by O
the O
organist O
is O
not O
an O
essential O
instrument O
in O
the O
performance O
of O
a O
part O
of O
those O
services O
, O
and O
it O
is O
clearly O
exempt O
from O
taxation O
because O
used O
exclusively O
for O
religious O
purposes O
and O
in O
religious O
exercises O
in O
the O
church. O
The O
salary O
of O
the O
organist O
must O
necessarily O
be O
paid O
by O
the O
church O
, O
and O
the O
money O
thus O
paid O
, O
it O
is O
equally O
clear O
, O
is O
expended O
exclusively O
for O
religious O
purposes. O
The O
fact O
that O
this O
money O
may O
be O
taxable O
after O
it O
is O
paid O
to O
the O
organist O
, O
or O
that O
the O
things O
purchased O
with O
it O
by O
the O
organist O
may O
be O
taxable O
in O
his O
or O
her O
hands O
, O
makes O
no O
difference O
in O
the O
determination O
of O
this O
question. O
The O
employees O
of O
a O
charitable O
institution O
are O
not O
compelled O
to O
perform O
free O
services O
in O
order O
that O
the O
institution O
may O
be O
charitable. O
If O
that O
were O
true O
, O
charitable O
institutions O
could O
not O
employ O
janitors O
or O
other O
persons O
to O
do O
services O
for O
them O
of O
any O
kind O
without O
the O
danger O
of O
losing O
their O
character O
as O
charitable O
institutions. O
Church O
music O
is O
by O
many O
religious O
organizations O
regarded O
as O
one O
of O
the O
essentials O
of O
religious O
services. O
The O
best O
church O
organist O
is O
the O
one O
most O
desired O
, O
and O
our O
law O
exempting O
church O
property O
could O
not O
be O
reasonably O
construed O
as O
denying O
to O
any O
church O
organization O
the O
right O
to O
have O
the O
best O
organist O
within O
its O
means O
, O
and O
to O
be O
allowed O
to O
pay O
the O
salary O
for O
the O
same O
, O
without O
subjecting O
itself O
to O
the O
charge O
that O
it O
is O
an O
organization O
for O
profit. O
While O
the O
organist O
is O
essential O
to O
the O
exercises O
of O
the O
church O
in O
question O
, O
still O
the O
organist O
is O
not O
the O
corporation O
and O
is O
not O
necessarily O
an O
officer O
of O
the O
corporation O
or O
a O
part O
of O
it O
, O
and O
if O
he O
were O
, O
that O
would O
have O
no O
tendency O
to O
take O
away O
from O
it O
its O
standing O
as O
a O
charitable O
institution O
, O
as O
the O
salary O
paid O
him O
only O
inures O
to O
his O
profit O
personally O
. O
*370What O
we O
have O
said O
as O
to O
the O
money O
paid O
to O
the O
organist O
as O
salary O
is O
equally O
true O
as O
to O
that O
paid O
to O
the O
minister O
on O
his O
salary. O
The O
minister\u2019s O
services O
, O
as O
such O
, O
are O
a O
necessary O
part O
of O
the O
religious O
services O
and O
the O
money O
spent O
for O
his O
salary O
is O
necessarily O
money O
spent O
or O
used O
for O
religious O
purposes O
, O
and O
it O
is O
exclusively O
used O
for O
religious O
purposes O
when O
it O
is O
thus O
paid O
or O
spent. O
Of O
course O
, O
the O
money O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
minister O
is O
taxable O
, O
and O
so O
is O
all O
other O
property O
that O
he O
purchases O
with O
it O
, O
but O
this O
has O
no O
tendency O
to O
show O
that O
the O
$30 O
, O
000 O
, O
or O
the O
income O
therefrom O
, O
is O
not O
used O
exclusively O
for O
religious O
purposes O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
the O
trustees. O
It O
is O
the O
intended O
use O
of O
the O
trust O
fund O
and O
the O
actual O
use O
made O
of O
it O
and O
the O
income O
therefrom O
that O
determine O
the O
question O
whether O
it O
is O
exempt O
from O
taxation O
, O
and O
not O
what O
becomes O
of O
the O
income O
after O
it O
is O
thus O
used O
. O
The O
nearest O
case O
parallel O
to O
the O
one O
now O
in O
hand O
that O
this O
court O
has O
decided O
is O
Monticello O
Seminary O
v. O
Board O
of O
Review O
, O
249 O
Ill. O
481 O
, O
in O
which O
we O
held O
that O
$35 O
, O
000 O
donated O
to O
the O
Monticello O
Seminary O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
furnishing O
free O
scholarships O
, O
to O
be O
paid O
out O
of O
the O
annual O
income O
of O
that O
endowment O
, O
was O
exempt O
from O
taxation. O
The O
gift O
in O
that O
case O
as O
in O
this O
was O
for O
a O
specific O
purpose O
, O
\u2014 O
a O
charity O
, O
\u2014 O
and O
we O
held O
that O
the O
income O
from O
it O
was O
not O
a O
profit O
in O
any O
sense O
in O
which O
that O
word O
can O
properly O
be O
used. O
That O
case O
is O
so O
clearly O
decisive O
of O
the O
one O
now O
in O
hand O
that O
we O
deem O
it O
unnecessary O
to O
cite O
further O
authorities O
. O
The O
$25 O
a O
year O
to O
be O
spent O
for O
books O
for O
the O
church O
is O
so O
clearly O
money O
used O
or O
to O
be O
used O
for O
religious O
purposes O
that O
no O
further O
argument O
or O
comment O
seems O
to O
be O
necessary O
. O
The O
cases O
cited O
by O
appellee O
holding O
parsonages O
and O
other O
such O
property O
not O
exempt O
are O
not O
at O
all O
analogous O
to O
the O
question O
now O
in O
hand. O
A O
parsonage O
used O
by O
the O
minister O
as O
a O
home O
for O
himself O
and O
family O
is O
used O
and O
occupied O
just O
like O
any O
other O
home O
when O
the O
minister O
is O
put O
in O
possession O
of O
it O
, O
and O
when O
he O
uses O
it O
as O
his O
hdme O
it O
is O
in O
his O
possession O
and O
use O
as O
such O
, O
and O
it O
cannot O
be O
said O
to O
be O
then O
in O
use O
by O
*371the O
church O
for O
religious O
purposes. O
Such O
property O
is O
more O
analogous O
to O
that O
of O
the O
salary O
of O
the O
minister O
after O
it O
has O
been O
paid O
to O
him. O
For O
the O
foregoing O
reasons O
we O
have O
held O
that O
the O
holding O
by O
a O
church O
of O
such O
property O
is O
for O
secular O
and O
not O
religious O
purposes O

, O
who O
, O
pursuant O

an O
agreement O
with O
the O
grantors O
, O
conveyed O
the O

to O
Emilie. O
In O
1885 O
Horn O
purchased O
from O
the O
owners O
the O
other O
undivided O
one-half O
of O
the O
property O
and O
caused O
the O
deed O
to O

, O
who O
thereby O
became O
vested O
with O
the O
legal O
title O

the O
entire O

At O
the O
time O
the O

desired O

die O
, O
but O
it O
was O

his O
health O
became O
good O
, O
and O
requested O
him O

that O
Horn O
was O

The O
decree O
ordered O
the O
master O
in O
chancery O
to O
execute O
to O
Horn O
a O

for O
the O
property. O
Horn O
was O

The O
injunction O
was O
granted O
without O

and O
without O
notice O
to O
the O
defendants. O
There O
are O
two O
judges O
of O
the O
city O
court O
of O
East O
St. O
Louis O
, O
and O
the O
case O
was O
assigned O
by O
the O
clerk O
to O
the O
division O
presided O
over O
by O
Judge O
Borders. O
Defendants O
to O
the O
bill O
answered O
, O
denying O
its O
material O
allegations O
, O
and O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O
dissolve O
the O
injunction O
and O
dismiss O
the O
bill O
for O
want O
of O
equity. O
The O
motion O
was O
set O
down O
to O
be O
heard O
on O
the O
21st O
of O
July O
, O
1923 O
, O
and O
on O
that O
date O
the O

filed O
his O
affidavit O
praying O
a O
change O
of O
venue O
on O
account O
of O
the O

of O
the O
judge. O
The O
affidavit O

on O
the O
20th O
of O

alleged O
knowledge O

not O
come O

No O

of O
an O

for O
a O

The O
court O
denied O
the O
motion O
and O
entered O
a O
decree O
dissolving O
the O
injunction O
and O
dismissing O
the O
bill O
for O
want O
of O
equity O
, O
from O
which O
decree O
this O
appeal O
is O
prosecuted O
. O
Appellant\u2019s O
contention O
is O
that O
the O
decree O
of O
the O
city O
court O
of O
1888 O
was O
an O
adjudication O
that O
Emilie O
Horn O
held O
the O
legal O
title O
to O
the O
property O
in O
trust O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
the O
equitable O
owner O
thereof O
, O
and O
that O
by O
the O
warranty O
deed O
from O
Horn O
to O
appellant O
he O
(appellant) O
became O
the O
equitable O
owner O
of O
the O
interest O
in O
the O
title O
which O
descended O
from O
Emilie O
Horn O
to O
the O
three O
depeased O
infants O
and O
the O
legal O
title O
to O
all O
their O
interest O
in O
the O
property. O
As O
only O
legal O
titles O
prevail O
in O
an O
action O
of O
ejectment O
, O
appellant O
could O
not O
avail O
himself O
of O
his O
defense O
as O
the O
equitable O
owner O
in O
the O
ejectment O
suit O
, O
and O
it O
is O
contended O
the O
court O
erred O
in O
dissolving O
the O
injunction O
and O
dismissing O
\u2019 O
the O
bill O
until O
a O
hearing O
could O
be O
had O
on O
the O
merits O
thereof O
. O
The O
bill O
in O
this O
case O
is O
based O
on O
the O
theory O
appellees O
claimed O
to O
have O
acquired O
their O
title O
by O
descent O
from O
the O
three O
deceased O
infant O
children O
of O
Emilie O
Horn; O
that O
she O
only O
held O
the O
legal O
title O
in O
trust O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
the O
beneficial O

, O
which O
was O
declared O
in O
the O
decree O

, O
never O

and O
that O
the O
deceased O
children O
only O
inherited O
the O
legal O
title O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
trust. O
It O
is O
claimed O
the O
judgment O
for O
appellees O
in O
the O
ejectment O
suit O
is O
contrary O
to O
the O
decree O
of O
the O
city O
court O
of O
1888 O
, O
and O
the O
prayer O
is O
for O
a O
decree O
that O
Emilie O
Horn O
had O
no O
interest O
in O
the O
property O
except O
that O
she O
held O
the O
legal O
title O
in O
trust O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
and O
at O
her O
death O
her O

title O
, O
subject O
to O
the O
same O
trust O
for O
the O

, O
Gustav O

, O
and O
that O
the O
interest O
and O
title O
the O
deceased O
triplet O
children O
inherited O
from O
their O

was O
subject O
to O
the O

his O
legal O

equitable O
title O
passed O
to O

by O

from O
Horn O
. O
While O
the O
bill O
alleges O
the O
judgment O
for O
plaintiffs O
in O
the O
ejectment O
suit O
was O
contrary O
to O
the O
decree O
of O
1888 O
, O
this O
court O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
decided O
that O
it O
was O
not. O
There O
can O
be O
no O
doubt O
the O
deceased O
triplet O
children O
inherited O
from O
their O
mother O
only O
the O
same O
character O
of O
title O
she O
held O
, O
which O
was O
decreed O
to' O
be O
the O
naked O
legal O
title O
held O
in O
trust O
for O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
the O
beneficial O
owner O
, O
and O
appellees O
inherited O
from O
the O
deceased O
infants O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
title O
the O
infants O
had. O
This O
court O
, O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
, O
held O
in O
the O
ejectment O
suit O
, O
and O
in O
another O
suit O
which O
involved O
the O
effect O
of O
the O
decree O
and O
the O
master\u2019s O
deed O
made O
pursuant O
thereto O
, O
that O
the O
decree O
and O
master\u2019s O
deed O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
title O
inherited O
by O
the O
deceased O
infants O
from O
their O
mother. O
Instead O
of O
the O
judgment O
for O
plaintiffs O
in O
ejectment O
being O
contrary O
to O
the O
decree O
of O
1888 O
it O
was O
in O
harmony O
with O
it O
as O
the O
decree O
was O
construed O
by O
this O
court. O
We O
think O
it O
must O
be O
held O
that O
Horn\u2019s O
deed O
conveyed O
all O
the O
title O
he O
had O
to O
the O
property O
, O
which O
was O
the O
legal O
title O
to O
the O
entire O
interest O
, O
except O
the O
interest O
inherited O
by O
the O
three O
deceased O
infants O
from O
their O
mother O
and O
by O
plaintiffs O
from O
the O
deceased O
infants. O
As O
to O
that O
share O
of O
the O
property O
appellant O
acquired O
only O
the O
equitable O
title O
of O
the O
grantor. O
The O
legal O
title O
was O
in O
appellees O
, O
*179and O
appellant\u2019s O
equitable O
title O
could O
not O
be O
availed O
of O
by O
him O
in O
an O
action O
of O
ejectment O
to O
defeat O
the O
legal O
title O
. O
The O
ejectment O
suit O
was O
begun O
by O
appellees O
in O
July O
, O
1906. O
The O
first O
trial O
resulted O
in O
a O
judgment O
for O
defendant O
there O
, O
appellant O
here. O
This O
court O
reversed O
that O
judgment O
and O
remanded O
the O
case O
in O
April O
, O
1908. O
(Horn O
v. O
Metzger O
, O
supra.) O
The O
case O
was O
again O
tried O
, O
a O
verdict O
returned O
for O
defendant O
, O
and O
that O
verdict O
was O
set O
aside. O
It O
was O
not O
again O
tried O
until O
July O
, O
1919 O
, O
eleven O
years O
after O
the O
reversal O
, O
when O
a O
judgment O
was O
rendered O
for O
appellees O
, O
who O
were O
the O
plaintiffs O
in O
that O
suit. O
As O
we O
have O
said O
, O
no O
appeal O
was O
prosecuted O
or O
writ O
of O
error O
sued O
out O
to O
review O
the O
judgment O
, O
and O
the O
bill O
in O
this O
case O
was O
not O
filed O
until O
April O
, O
1923 O
, O
almost O
four O
years O
after O
the O
judgment O
was O
rendered. O
Appellant O
contends O
the O
judgment O
never O
became O
final O
, O
but O
only O
interlocutory O
, O
until O
the O
commissioners O
reported O
and O
the O
report O
was O
approved. O
Section O
34 O
of O
the O
chapter O
on O
ejectment O
provides O
that O
every O
judgment O
in O
ejectment O
shall O
be O
conclusive O
as O
to O
the O
title O
established O
in O
the O
action. O
That O
, O
of O
course O
, O
is O
subject O
to O
the O
right O
of O
the O
court O
to O
grant O
a O
new O
trial O
, O
or O
the O
right O
of O
the O
defeated O
party O
to O
a O
new O
trial O
, O
upon O
the O
payment O
of O
costs O
, O
within O
one O
year O
, O
as O
provided O
by O
section O
35. O
Section O
55 O
provides O
for O
the O
appointment O
of O
seven O
persons O
(five O
of O
whom O
shall O
have O
authority O
to O
act) O
to O
value O
improvements O
made O
, O
before O
notice O
of O
the O
adverse O
claim O
and O
do O
other O
things O
enumerated O
in O
said O
section O
, O
and O
upon O
their O
report O
a O
judgment O
may O
be O
entered O
and O
execution O
issued. O
The O
contention O
that O
the O
judgment O
does O
not O
become O
final O
until O
the O
commissioners\u2019 O
report O
is O
approved O
, O
we O
think O
is O
untenable. O
The O
judgment O
is O
final O
as O
to O
the O
title O
established O
when O
rendered O
, O
but O
for O
the O
exceptions O
referred O
to. O
Where O
a O
plaintiff O
in O
an O
ejectment O
suit' O
has O
the O
naked O
legal O
title O
to O
property O
of O
which O
the O
defendant O
is O
the O
equitable O
owner O
, O
equity O
may O
, O
on O
a O
bill O
filed O
for O
that O
purpose O
, O
enjoin O
the O
prosecution O
of O
the O
ejectment O
suit O
until O
the O
bill O
can O
be O
heard O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
the O
title O
determined O
and O
declared O
, O
but O
*180we O
are O
obliged O
to O
treat O
the O
bill O
in O
this O
case O
as O
a O
bill O
to O
enjoin O
the O
enforcement O
of O
a O
final O
judgment. O
The O
jurisdiction O
of O
a O
court O
of O
equity O
to O
enjoin O
the O
enforcement O
of O
a O
judgment O
, O
while O
well O
established O
, O
is O
not O
a O
favorite O
subject O
of O
such O
jurisdiction O
, O
and O
it O
will O
not O
be O
sufficient O
simply O
to O
show O
injustice O
has O
been O
done O
by O
the O
judgment O
, O
but O
it O
must O
also O
appear O
the O
judgment O
was O
not O
the O
result O
of O
inattention O
or O
negligence. O
(Vennum O
v. O
Davis O
, O

The O

diligence. O

The O
decision O
of O
this O
court O
in O
1908 O
in O
Horn O
v. O
Metzger O
held O
the O
legal O
title O
to O
the O
share O
of O
the O
property O
claimed O
by O
plaintiffs O
in O
the O
ejectment O
suit O
was O
in O
plaintiffs O
, O
and O
reversed O
the O
judgment O
in O
favor O
of O
the O
defendant O
and O
remanded O
the O
case. O
The O
effect O
and O
plain O
meaning O
of O
that O
decision O
was O
that O
appellant\u2019s O
equitable O
title O
could O
not O
be O
availed O
of O
in O
defense O
of O
that O
action. O
With O
that O

did O
not O
take O
any O

enjoin O
the O
further O
prosecution O
of O
the O
suit O
until O
he O
could O
have O
a O

adjudicate O
the O

remained O
inactive O
until O
the O

eleven O
years O
later O
, O
and O
then O
, O
we O
must O
presume O
, O
again O
relied O
upon O
the O

title O

sought O
to O
establish O
at O
the O
first O
trial O
, O
and O
which O
, O
un&lt;Jer O
our O
decision O
, O
could O
not O

He O
remained O
inactive O

after O
the O

against O
him O
, O
four O
more O
years O
before O
he O
filed O
the O

Commissioners O

of O

of O

The O

the O

which O
was O
fifteen O

it O
is O
not O
shown O
any O

but O
we O
are O
of O
opinion O
that O
whatever O
appellant\u2019s O
rights O
may O
have O
been O
if O
he O
had O
been O
diligent O
in O
asserting O
them O

in O

of O
the O
history O
of O
the O

it O
in O
the O

four O
years O

against O
him O

he O
has O
been O
guilty O
of O
such O
negligence O
that O
a O
court O
of O
equity O
will O
not O
interfere O
in O

The O

Hobart O

to O
the O

The O
plaintiffs O
in O

claim O
title O
by O
descent O
from O
their O
father O
, O
John O
Kuhl O
, O
who O
, O
they O
claim O
, O
acquired O
title O
by O
adverse O
possession. O
When O
Gertrude O

married O
John O
Kuhl O
she O
was O
in O
possession O
of O
the O
land O
, O
and O
after O
the O
marriage O
she O
continued O
to O
live O
on O
the O
farm O
with O
her O
husband O
, O
who O
cultivated O
it. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
that O
he O
ever O
made O
any O
claim O
to O
own O
the O
land O
, O
but O
, O
on O
*172the O
contrary O
, O
he O
stated O
to O
several O
witnesses O
that O
he O
did O
not O
own O
the O
farm O
but O
his O
wife O
did O
. O
Adverse O
possession O
which O
may O
by O
lapse O
of O
time O
constitute O
a O
legal O
title O
must O
be O
hostile O
or O
adverse O
in O
its O
origin O
, O
actual O
, O
visible O
, O
notorious O
, O
exclusive O
and O
continuous O
and O
under O
a O
claim O
of O
ownership. O
(Zirngibl O
v. O
Calumet O
and O
Chicago O
Canal O
and O
Dock O
Co. O
157 O
Ill. O
430.) O
The O
complainants O
failed O
to O
establish O
several O
of O
these O
elements. O
The O
origin O
of O
John O
Kuhl\u2019s O
possession O
was O
not O
adverse O
, O
for O
it O
was O
by O
reason O
of O
the O
marriage O
and O
by O
consent O
of O
his O
wife; O
it O
was O
not O
under O
a O
claim O
of O
ownership O
, O
for O
he O
repudiated O
such O
claim; O
it O
was O
not O
notorious O
, O
for O
there O
was O
nothing O
to O
distinguish O
it O
from O
the O
ordinary O
possession O
by O
the O
family O
of O
land O
belonging O
to O
either O
the O
husband O
or O
the O
wife; O
and O
it O
was O
not O
exclusive O
, O
for O
the O
husband O
and O
wife O
occupied O
it O
in O
common. O
The O
exclusive O
possession O
by O
a O
husband O
of O
his O
wife\u2019s O
land O
is O
not O
necessarily O
adverse O
, O
especially O
when O
there O
is O
no O
proof O
of O
his O
claiming O
ownership. O
(Horn O
v. O
Metzger O
, O

On O
the O
death O
of O
Hobart O
Cannon O
the O
property O
descended O
to O
the O
defendants O
in O
error. O
The O
statute O
then O
provided O
that O
the O
widow O
might O
retain O
possession O
of O
the O
dwelling O
house O
in O
which O
her O
husband O
most O
usually O

(Rev. O

Dower O
was O
never O

Under O
the O
statute O
she O
had O
the O

of O
possession O
until O
that O
was O
done. O

was O
the O
origin O
of O
her O
possession. O
There O
is O
no O
evidence O
she O
ever O
claimed O
any O
other O
title. O
Upon O
her O
death O
this O
right O
came O
to O

and O

The O

who O
found O
that O
the O

James O
W. O

Fortner O
had O
been O

they O
lived O

by O
Fortner O

The O

was O
worth O
about O
$5500 O
, O
subject O
to O
a O
mortgage O
of O
$3000 O
, O
and O
they O
had O
commenced O
to O
construct O
another O
house O
on O
the O
property. O
Gerald O
was O
employed O
about O
eight O
months O
in O
a O

and O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
death O
was O

He O
paid O
his O

$10 O
a O

, O
and O
the O
actual O
cost O
of O
his O
board O
was O
$4 O
or O
$5. O
His O
mother O
had O
been O
a O
nurse O
, O
and O
he O
agreed O
to O
buy O
half O
her O
clothes O
if O
she O
would O
quit O

, O
and O
that O
arrangement O
was O
made. O
He O
was O

who O
were O

had O
purchased O
another O

, O
was O
dependent O
upon O
her O

, O
James O
W. O
Fortner O
, O
for O

, O
and O
there O
was O
no O
evidence O
that O
he O
did O
not O
fulfill O
his O
legal O
obligation O
, O
although O
he O
was O
sometimes O
ill O

claimed O
that O
there O
was O
, O
and O
the O
judgment O
for O
a O
lump O
sum O
of O
$3500 O
was O
not O
authorized O
by O
the O
statute. O
It O
is O
contended O
, O
however O
, O
that O
there O
was O
partial O
dependency O
, O
which O
may O
exist O
by O
virtue O
of O
a O
moral O
obligation O
arising O
out O
of O

act. O
(Superior O

Gerald O
paid O
his O
mother O
$10 O
a O
week O
, O
while O
his O
board O
did O
not O
cost O
her O
that O
much O
, O
and O
he O
was O
buying O
half O
her O
clothes O
under O
an O
arrangement O
with O
her O

such O

within O
the O
intent O
of O
the O
Workmen\u2019s O
Compensation O
act O
nor O
authorize O
the O
judgment. O
The O
substance O
of O
the O
judgment O
was O
that O
the O
husband O
, O
who O
was O
legally O
bound O
to O
support O
his O
wife O
and O
on O
whom O
she O
was O
a O

, O
was O
to O
support O
her O
in O
another O
way O
by O
taking O
money O
from O
him O
under O

act. O
The O

company O
was O
brought O
into O

, O
but O
the O
legal O
liability O
to O
make O
compensation O
, O
if O
there O
was O
any O
, O
was O
the O
liability O
of O
James O

There O
was O
no O
evidence O
what O
the O

with O
the O

anything O
more O
than O
to O
indemnify O
Fortner O
to O
the O

any O
legal O
liability. O
The O
judgment O

to O
the O
City O
of O

and O
displayed O
a O

The O
return O
address O
on O
Driscoll\u2019s O
letter O
was O
a O
post O
office O
box O
in O
Highland O
Park. O
Driscoll\u2019s O
letter O
also O
indicated O
that O
she O
had O
been O
ticketed O
for O
the O
same O
violation O
in O
2001 O
and O
the O
ticket O
had O
been O
dismissed O
because O
her O
vehicle O
displayed O
a O
Highland O

city O
sticker. O
In O
February O
2005 O
, O
an O
administrative O
law O
officer O
ruled O
against O
Driscoll O
, O
finding O
that O
because O
she O
lived O
in O
Chicago O
, O
her O
vehicle O
required O
a O
city O
sticker. O
Driscoll O
filed O
a O
complaint O
in O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Cook O
County O
for O
administrative O
review. O
The O
court O
reversed O
the O
determination O
of O
the O
administrative O
law O
officer O
and O
remanded O
the O
cause O
for O
a O
new O
hearing. O
Upon O
remand O
, O
a O
hearing O
was O
held O
before O
a O
different O
administrative O
law O
officer O
in O
December O
2005. O
The O
officer O
found O
in O
favor O
of O
Driscoll O
and O
dismissed O
the O
ticket. O
The O
City O
filed O
a O
complaint O
for O
judicial O
review O
, O
and O
the O
circuit O
court O
affirmed O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
ticket. O
The O
City O
now O
appeals O
. O
Initially O
, O
we O
note O
that O
the O
parties O
disagree O
as O
to O
the O
appropriate O
standard O
of O
review. O
The O
City O
contends O
that O
the O
interpretation O
of O
an O
ordinance O
is O
a O
question O
of O
law O
and O
should O
be O
reviewed O
de O
novo. O
Driscoll O
, O
who O
appears O
pro O
se O
, O
contends O
that O
because O
there O
are O
facts O
in O
dispute O
, O
we O
should O
review O
the O
administrative O
law O
officer\u2019s O
determination O
pursuant O
to O
the O
manifest O
weight O
of O
the O
evidence O
standard. O
Here O
, O
however O
, O
the O
facts O
are O
not O
in O
dispute. O
The O
only O
issue O
is O
the O
interpretation O
of O
the O
provisions O
of O
the O
Code O
relating O
to O
city O
stickers. O
Because O
an O
issue O
of O
statutory O
construction O
raises O
a O
question O
of O
law O
, O
our O
review O
is O

novo. O

Here O
, O
as O
a O
resident O
of O
Chicago O
, O
Driscoll O
was O
required O
to O
purchase O
a O

sticker O
for O
her O

Pursuant O

That O

that O
if O

resides O
within O

the O
vehicle O
must O

never O
contested O
that O
she O
resided O
in O

or O
that O
she O
was O
the O
registered O
owner O
of O
the O
vehicle. O
Whether O
the O
vehicle O
is O
based O
within O
the O
city O
limits O
does O
not O
determine O
whether O
the O
vehicle O
must O
display O
a O
city O
sticker. O
Section O
3 O
\u2014 O
56\u2014020 O
does O
provide O
that O
a O
vehicle O
that O
is O

the O

is O
entitled O

a O
credit O
against O
any O
fee O
paid O
to O

the O
vehicle O
is O
based O
, O
but O
the O
vehicle O
is O
still O
required O
to O
display O
a O
city O
sticker. O
Therefore O
, O
Driscoll\u2019s O
contention O
that O
her O
vehicle O
did O
not O
need O
a O
city O
sticker O
because O
it O
displayed O
a O
Highland O
Park O
city O
sticker O
must O
fail O
. O
Driscoll O
further O
contends O
that O
collateral O
estoppel O
precludes O
the O
City O
from O
relitigating O
this O
issue. O
She O
maintains O
that O
this O
same O
issue O
was O
already O
litigated O
in O
2001 O
when O
she O
received O
a O
ticket O
for O
the O
same O
violation O
, O
which O
was O
subsequently O
dismissed. O
However O
, O
Driscoll\u2019s O
argument O
is O
no O
more O
than O
a O
self-serving O
assertion O
that O
the O
same O
issue O
was O
actually O
litigated O
in O
2001 O
and O
she O
neither O
provides O
any O
citation O
to O
the O
record O
to O
support O
her O
assertion O
, O
nor O
can O
we O
determine O
from O
the O

before O
us O
whether O
the O

issue O
was O
actually O
litigated O
before. O
Without O
more O
, O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
address O
her O
contention O
and O
therefore O
reject O
it O
. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
reverse O
the O
order O

respondent O
argues O
that O

over O

for O

and O
thus O
that O
the O

likewise O

we O

JUSTICE B-A
McNULTY I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court; O
Our O
supreme O
court O
has O
ordered O
us O
to O
reconsider O
our O
initial O
resolution O
of O
this O
appeal O
from O
the O
dismissal O
of O
a O
postconviction O
petition. O
In O
our O
previous O
order O
we O
granted O
defendant O
, O
Jackie O
Chamness O
, O
the O
relief O
he O
sought O
when O
we O
reduced O
the O
sentence O
imposed O
following O
his O
guilty O
plea. O
In O
his O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
sought O
to O
withdraw O
his O
guilty O
plea. O
We O
must O
now O
determine O
the O
effect O
of O
defendant\u2019s O
new O
request O
on O
the O
resolution O
of O
the O
postconviction O
petition. O
We O
reverse O
the O
dismissal O
of O
the O
petition O
and O
remand O
to O
the O
trial O
court O
for O
further O
proceedings O
in O
accord O
with O
this O
opinion O
. O
BACKGROUND O
In O
1997 O
police O
arrested O
defendant O
for O
violating O
an O
order O
of O
protection O
that O
directed O
him O
to O
stay O
away O
from O
his O
former O
girlfriend. O
Inmates O
in O
jail O
with O
defendant O
while O
he O
awaited O
trial O
reported O
that O
he O
offered O
to O
pay O
them O
to O
kill O
his O
former O
girlfriend. O
Prosecutors O
charged O
defendant O
with O
solicitation O
of O
murder O
for O
hire. O
In O
1998 O
defendant O
negotiated O
a O
sentence O
totaling O
33 O
years O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
plea O
of O
guilty O
to O
the O
charges O
of O
aggravated O
stalking O
and O
solicitation O
of O
murder O
for O
hire. O
The O
court O
accepted O
the O
plea O
without O
informing O
defendant O
that O
statutes O
required O
the O
addition O
of O
a O
term O
of O
mandatory O
supervised O
release O
(MSR) O
following O
the O
completion O
of O
his O
sentence. O
When O
defendant O
entered O
his O
plea O
, O
he O
suggested O
that O
the O
inmates O
had O
encouraged O
him O
to O
solicit O
the O
murder O
. O
In O
2001 O
defendant O
filed O
his O
postconviction O
petition. O
He O
claimed O
that O
jailhouse O
informants O
entrapped O
him O
and O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
violated O
his O
constitutional O
rights O
by O
failing O
to O
inform O
him O
of O
the O
MSR. O
The O
trial O
court O
dismissed O
the O
petition. O
On O
appeal O
we O
found O
that O
the O
failure O
to O
inform O
defendant O
of O
the O
MSR O
term O
violated O
his O
right O
to O
due O
process. O
Because O
defendant O
, O
in O
his O
briefs O
to O
this O
court O
, O
said O
he O
did O
not O
wish O
to O
withdraw O
his O
guilty O
plea O
, O
we O
granted O
him O
relief O
by O
reducing O
his O
sentence O
by O
the O
length O
of O
the O
MSR O
term O
. O
*494In O
light O
of O
defendant\u2019s O
request O
for O
leave O
to O
withdraw O
his O
guilty O
plea O
, O
our O
supreme O
court O
directed O
us O
to O
appoint O
an O
attorney O
to O
counsel O
defendant O
about O
the O
ramifications O
of O
his O
request. O
We O
have O
done O
so O
, O
and O
following O
the O
consultation O
, O
defendant O
has O
reasserted O
his O
desire O
to O
withdraw O
his O
guilty O
plea O
. O
Our O
supreme O
court\u2019s O
supervisory O
order O
directed O
us O
to O
reconsider O
the O
case O
in O
light O
of O
People O
v. O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
177 O
(2005). O
The O
defendant O
in O
Whitfield O
pled O
guilty O
to O
first O
degree O
murder O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
sentence O
of O
25 O
years. O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O
179. O
The O
court O
did O
not O
advise O
the O
defendant O
that O
a O
three-year O
period O
of O
MSR O
would O
follow O
completion O
of O
the O
sentence. O
In O
a O
postconviction O
petition O
the O
defendant O
claimed O
that O
the O
imposition O
of O
a O
greater O
sentence O
than O
that O
to O
which O
he O
agreed O
deprived O
him O
of O
due O
process. O
Our O
supreme O
court O
agreed. O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O
195. O
The O
defendant O
did O
not O
seek O
a O
new O
trial; O
instead O
, O
he O
sought O
to O
enforce O
the O
bargain O
he O
reached O
with O
the O
prosecution O
and O
the O
court. O
Because O
statutory O
law O
required O
the O
three-year O
term O
of O
MSR O
, O
our O
supreme O
court O
reduced O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
sentence O
to O
22 O
years O
, O
with O
3 O
following O
years O
of O
MSR. O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O
205 O
. O
Our O
supreme O
court O
in O
Whitfield O
discussed O
the O
options O
available O
to O
defendants O
in O
cases O
involving O
lack O
of O
MSR O
admonishment. O
The O
prosecution O
argues O
that O
none O
of O
those O
options O
apply O
here O
because O
defendant O
forfeited O
the O
issue O
by O
failing O
to O
raise O
it O
on O
direct O
appeal. O
In O
Whitfield O
the O
court O
noted O
the O
incongruity O
of O
holding O
that O
the O
defendant O
forfeited O
the O
issue: O
\u201cTo O
so O
hold O
would O
place O
the O
onus O
on O
defendant O
to O
ensure O
his O
own O
admonishment O
in O
accord O
with O
due O
process.\u201d O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O
188. O
The O
court O
addressed O
the O
MSR O
issue O
on O
the O
merits O
despite O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
failure O
to O
raise O
the O
issue O
on O
direct O
appeal. O
We O
find O
the O
reasoning O
of O
Whitfield O
applicable O
here. O
Defendant O
has O
not O
forfeited O
his O
claim O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
violated O
his O
right O
to O
due O
process O
by O
accepting O
his O
guilty O
plea O
in O
exchange O
for O
a O
negotiated O
sentence O
without O
informing O
him O
that O
he O
would O
also O
serve O
a O
term O
of O
MSR O
. O
The O
prosecution O
concedes O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
did O
not O
admonish O
defendant O
about O
MSR. O
Thus O
, O
under O
Whitfield O
, O
defendant O
has O
established O
a O
violation O
of O
his O
constitutional O
rights. O
Our O
supreme O
court O
stressed O
two O
possible O
remedies O
when O
a O
defendant O
has O
not O
received O
the O
benefit O
of O
his O
bargain O
due O
to O
incomplete O
admonishments. O
Either O
the O
court O
must O
fulfill O
its O
promise O
, O
by O
reducing O
the O
sentence O
to O
accommodate O
the O
MSR O
term O
, O
\u201cor O
defendant O
must O
be O
given O
the O
opportunity O
to O
withdraw O
his O
plea.\u201d O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O
202 O
. O
Our O
supreme O
court O
cited O
in O
support O
James O
v. O
State O
, O
699 O
N.W2d O
723 O
(Minn. O
2005). O
The O
trial O
court O
in O
that O
case O
did O
not O
inform O
the O
defendant O
of O
a O
mandated O
conditional O
release O
term O
that O
would O
follow O
completion O
of O
his O
negotiated O
sentence. O
The O
Minnesota O
Supreme O
Court O
*495found O
a O
violation O
of O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
constitutional O
rights O
, O
but O
the O
court O
neither O
reduced O
the O
sentence O
nor O
granted O
the O
defendant O
a O
new O
trial. O
Our O
supreme O
court O
noted O
that O
the O
court O
in O
James O
\u201cremanded O
for O
further O
proceedings O
, O
stating O
that O
, O
due O
to O
the O
petitioner\u2019s O
substantial O
delay O
in O
bringing O
his O
claim O
, O
the O
court O
should O
determine O
whether O
allowing O
petitioner O
to O
withdraw O
his O
plea O
would O
be O
unduly O
prejudicial O
to O
the O
State O
, O
in O
which O
case O
, O
defendant O
would O
be O
limited O
to O
the O
alternative O
remedy.\u201d O
Whitfield O
, O
217 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O

. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
we O
have O
no O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
from O
which O
we O
can O
determine O
whether O
a O
retrial O
would O
unduly O
prejudice O
the O
prosecution. O
Accordingly O
, O
following O
the O
reasoning O
of O
James O
, O
we O
remand O
to O
the O
trial O
court O
for O
a O
hearing O
concerning O
the O
prejudice O
to O
the O
prosecution O
that O
might O
follow O

JUSTICE B-A
HUTCHINSON I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Following O
a O
bench O
trial O
, O
defendant O
was O
convicted O
of O
the O
offense O
of O
failing O
to O
register O
as O
a O
sex O
offender O
(730 O

150/3 O
(West O

, O
and O
was O

The O

upon O

failure O
to O

as O
a O
sex O
offender O
with O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department O
within O
10 O
days O
of O
establishing O
a O
residence O
in O
Dixon O
in O
2003. O
On O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
contends O
that O
the O
State O
failed O
to O
prove O
him O
guilty O
of O
the O
offense O
beyond O
a O
reasonable O
doubt. O
Specifically O
, O
defendant O
argues O
that O
the O
State O
failed O
to O
prove O
that O
defendant O
resided O
in O
Dixon O
for O
a O
period O
of O
10 O
days O
or O
more. O
After O
a O
review O
of O
the O
record O
, O
we O
find O
that O
the O
State O
presented O
sufficient O
evidence O
to O
establish O
defendant\u2019s O
residence O
in O
Dixon O
for O
an O
aggregate O
period O
of O
10 O
days O
or O
more O
and O
we O
affirm O
defendant\u2019s O
conviction O
. O
When O
considering O
a O
challenge O
to O
the O
sufficiency O
of O
the O
evidence O
, O
the O
relevant O
question O
is O
whether O
, O
after O
viewing O
the O
evidence O
in O
the O
light O
most O
favorable O
to O
the O
prosecution O
, O
any O
rational O
trier O
of O
fact O
could O
have O
found O
the O
essential O
elements O
of O
the O
crime O
beyond O
a O
reasonable O
doubt. O

(West O

. O
We O
conclude O
that O
a O
rational O
trier O
of O
fact O
could O
have O
found O
beyond O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
that O
defendant O
resided O
in O
Dixon O
for O
an O
aggregate O
period O
of O
10 O
or O
more O
days O
and O
that O
he O
failed O
to O
register O
with O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department O
within O
10 O
days O
of O
establishing O
his O
residence O
there. O
The O
evidence O
established O
that O
defendant O
was O
incarcerated O
in O
the O
Lee O
County O
jail O
until O
October O
26 O
, O
2003. O
The O
State O
also O
introduced O
evidence O
that O
defendant O
established O
a O
residence O
in O
Dixon O
following O
his O
release O
from O
jail. O
This O
evidence O
included O
the O
testimony O
of O
Adam O
Koehler O
, O
who O
managed O
the O
apartment O
building O
located O
at O
805V2 O
W. O
Third O
Street O
in O
Dixon O
and O
lived O
next O
door. O
Koehler O
testified O
that O
defendant\u2019s O
girlfriend O
, O
Mary O
Grandberry O
, O
lived O
in O
this O
building O
and O
that O
defendant O
moved O
in O
with O
Grandberry O
on O
October O
26 O
, O
2003. O
Koehler O
testified O
that O
he O
observed O
defendant\u2019s O
presence O
in O
the O
building O
every O
evening O
and O
that O
defendant O
was O
there O
\u201call O
of O
the O
time.\u201d O
Additionally O
, O
various O
officers O
of O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department O
testified O
that O
they O
had O
numerous O
contacts O
with O
defendant O
in O
Dixon O
during O
October O
and O
November O
2003. O
On O
October O
30 O
, O
2003 O
, O
defendant O
went O
to O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department O
and O
indicated O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
register O
as O
a O
sex O
offender O
because O
he O
was O
living O
in O
Dixon O
at O
805V2 O
W. O
Third O
Street. O
On O
this O
occasion O
, O
however O
, O
defendant O
became O
upset O
about O
an O
error O
in O
a O
report O
indicating O
that O
he O
was O
a O
sexual O
predator O
rather O
than O
a O
sexual O
offender O
, O
and O
he O
left O
the O
police O
station O
without O
registering. O
On O
November O
7 O
, O
2003 O
, O
defendant O
was O
stopped O
in O
his O
vehicle O
by O
a O
Dixon O
police O
officer O
for O
driving O
with O
a O
suspended O
license. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
this O
stop O
, O
defendant O
informed O
the O
officer O
that O
he O
lived O
at O
805V2 O
W. O
Third O
Street O
in O
Dixon O
and O
this O
address O
was O
printed O
on O
defendant\u2019s O
citation O
and O
bond O
paperwork. O
On O
November O
9 O
, O
2003 O
, O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department O
responded O
to O
a O
domestic O
dispute O
between O
defendant O
and O
Grand-berry O
at O
805V2 O
W. O
Third O
Street. O
Later O
that O
day O
, O
defendant O
was O
again O
stopped O
in O
his O
vehicle O
for O
driving O
with O
a O
suspended O
license. O
At O
this O
time O
, O
defendant O
told O
the O
officer O
that O
he O
had O
lived O
in O
Dixon O
for O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
months. O
Once O
again O
, O
the O
805V2 O
W. O
Third O
Street O
address O
was O
*377printed O
on O
defendant\u2019s O
citation. O
On O
November O
16 O
, O
2003 O
, O
Dixon O
police O
responded O
to O
another O
disturbance O
involving O
defendant O
at O
the O
805V2 O
W O
Third O
Street O
address. O
On O
December O
8 O
, O
2003 O
, O
defendant O
registered O
as O
a O
sex O
offender O
with O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department; O
defendant\u2019s O
registration O
indicated O
that O
he O
resided O
at O
805x/2 O
W. O
Third O
Street. O
From O
such O
evidence O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
a O
rational O
trier O
of O
fact O
could O
conclude O
beyond O
a O
reasonable O
doubt O
that O
, O
following O
his O
release O
from O
jail O
on O
October O
26 O
, O
2003 O
, O
defendant O
resided O
at O
805V2 O
W O
Third O
Street O
in O
Dixon O
for O
an O
aggregate O
period O
of O
10 O
or O
more O
days O
and O
that O
he O
failed O
to O
register O
with O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department O
within O
10 O
days O
of O
establishing O
his O
residence O
there O
. O
In O
urging O
reversal O
, O
defendant O
relies O
upon O
evidence O
introduced O
at O
trial O
that O
he O
stayed O
with O
Grandberry O
for O
only O
a O
few O
nights O
following O
his O
release O
from O
jail O
and O
that O
he O
subsequently O
lived O
in O
Chicago. O
Defendant O
relies O
on O
evidence O
that O
he O
had O
registered O
as O
a O
sex O
offender O
in O
Chicago O
on O
November O
3 O
, O
2003; O
that O
he O
paid O
rent O
for O
a O
hotel O
room O
in O
Chicago O
for O
the O
month O
of O
November O
2003; O
and O
that O
he O
had O
an O
Illinois O
identification O
card O
with O
a O
Chicago O
post O
office O
box O
as O
an O
address. O
Defendant O
also O
argues O
that O
Koehler\u2019s O
testimony O
was O
\u201ctainted O
by O
his O
animosity O
toward O
[defendant].\u201d O
Such O
arguments O
are O
unavailing. O
Defendant\u2019s O
sex O
offender O
registration O
in O
Chicago O
and O
his O
rental O
of O
a O
hotel O
room O
and O
post O
office O
box O
in O
Chicago O
did O
not O
preclude O
the O
trial O
court O
from O
concluding O
that O
defendant O
had O
resided O
in O
Dixon O
for O
an O
aggregate O
of O
10 O
or O
more O
days O
after O
his O
release O
from O
jail O
on O
October O
26 O
, O
2003 O
, O
and O
that O
he O
had O
a O
duty O
under O
section O
3 O
of O
the O
Act O
to O
register O
with O
the O
Dixon O
police O
department. O
Indeed O
, O
section O
3(a) O
of O
the O
Act O
defines O
residence O
or O
temporary O
domicile O
as O
\u201cany O
and O
all O
places\u201d O
a O
defendant O
resides O
for O
an O
aggregate O
of O
10 O
or O
more O
days O
in O
a O
particular O
calendar O
year. O
730 O
ILCS O
150/3(a) O
(West O

Moreover O
, O
section O
3(b) O
imposes O
a O
duty O
to O
register O
within O
10 O
days O
of O
establishing O
a O

\u201cregardless O
of O

prior O
, O
or O
other O
registration.\u201d O
730 O
ILCS O
150/3(b) O
(West O

The O
trial O
court O
was O
in O
the O
best O
position O
to O
assess O
the O
credibility O
of O
the O
witnesses O
(Collins O
, O
106 O
Ill. O
2d O
at O

, O
and O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
could O
have O
reasonably O
concluded O
based O
upon O
the O
testimony O
of O
Koehler O
and O
the O
Dixon O

officers O
that O
defendant O

without O

(the O

, O
which O

to O

, O

The O

The O
issues O

are: O
(1) O
whether O
the O
provision O
of O
the O
Agreement O
that O
increased O
the O
amount O
to O
be O
paid O
from O
$25 O
, O
000 O
to O
$79 O
, O
000 O
in O
the O
event O
of O
a O
missed O
monthly O
payment O
is O
an O
unenforceable O
penalty; O
and O
(2) O
whether O
Bush\u2019s O
acceptance O
of O
the O
missed O
monthly O
payment O
and O
subsequent O
payments O
waives O
Schmiege\u2019s O

breach O
of O

For O
the O
reasons O
that O
follow O
, O
we O

Bush O
was O
told O
by O

that O

were O
insufficient O
funds O
to O

the O
check. O
On O
May O
30 O
, O
2006 O
, O
Bush O
sent O
written O
notice O
to O
Schmiege O
that O
he O
was O
in O
default O
on O
the O
Agreement O
and O
that O
he O
had O
10 O
days O
to O
cure O
the O
default. O
According O
to O
Schmiege O
, O
he O
did O
not O
receive O
the O
notice. O
In O
any O
event O
, O
Schmiege O
did O
not O
cure O
the O
default O
within O
the O
10-day O
grace O
period O
. O
On O
June O
21 O
, O
2006 O
, O
Bush O
moved O
for O
enforcement O
of O
the O
Agreement O
and O
for O
entry O
of O
judgment O
, O
based O
on O
section O
2(b) O
of O
the O
Agreement. O
Bush O
sought O
a O
judgment O
for O
$79 O
, O
000 O
(less O
$7 O
, O
916.67 O
in O
payments O
previously O
made O
by O
Schmiege) O
plus O
attorney O
fees O
and O
costs O
. O
While O
Bush\u2019s O
motion O
for O
enforcement O
was O
pending O
, O
Bush O
received O
monthly O
payments O
from O
Schmiege O
totaling O
$2 O
, O
916.68. O
This O
amount O
included O
the O
missed O
May O
2006 O
payment O
, O
which O
Schmiege O
mailed O
when O
he O
received O
the O
motion O
for O
enforcement O
and O
first O
learned O
that O
his O
check O
had O
been O
returned. O
Bush O
did O
not O
deposit O
the O
payments O
when O
he O
received O
them. O
Instead O
, O
he O
held O
them O
, O
awaiting O
the O
outcome O
of O
his O
motion O
to O
enforce. O
However O
, O
as O
the O
months O
passed O
without O
a O
ruling O
on O
his O
motion O
, O
Bush O
became O
concerned O
that O
the O
checks O
would O
lapse O
and O
that O
such O
lapse O
might O
be O
interpreted O
as O
a O
waiver O
of O
his O
rights O
under O
the O
Agreement. O
So O
, O
on O
November O
22 O
, O
2006 O
, O
Bush O
deposited O
the O
checks O
. O
On O
January O
12 O
, O
2007 O
, O
Schmiege O
filed O
a O
response O
to O
Bush\u2019s O
motion O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
provision O
of O
the O
Agreement O
\u201ccalling O
for O
a O
payment O
in O
excess O
of O
$50 O
, O
000 O
for O
missing O
one O
$416.67 O
[sic] O
installment O
amount[s] O
to O
an O
unenforceable O
penalty.\u201d O
Schmiege O
also O
argued O
that O
he O
was O
not O
properly O
notified O
of O
the O
missed O
payment O
and O
that O
he O
did O
not O
receive O
actual O
notice O
of O
the O
missed O
payment O
. O
Following O
a O
hearing O
on O
February O
6 O
, O
2007 O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
found O
that O
Schmiege O
was O
in O
default O
under O
the O
Agreement O
and O
that O
the O
provision O
providing O
for O
an O
increased O
settlement O
amount O
was O
not O
an O
unenforceable O
penalty. O
However O
, O
the O
court O
determined O
that O
Bush O
had O
waived O
his O
right O
to O
the O
increased O
amount O
by O
depositing O
the O
installment O
payments O
subsequently O
provided O
by O
Schmiege O
. O
On O
March O
7 O
, O
2007 O
, O
Bush O
moved O
for O
reconsideration O
, O
arguing O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
erred O
in O
finding O
waiver. O
The O
trial O
court O
agreed O
, O
and O
on O
*508May O
14 O
, O
2007 O
, O
it O
entered O
judgment O
for O
Bush O
for O
$79 O
, O
000 O
, O
less O
amounts O
previously O
paid O
by O
Schmiege O
, O
along O
with O
attorney O
fees O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$14 O
, O
455. O
Schmiege O
timely O
appealed O
. O
ANALYSIS O
The O
issue O
is O
whether O
section O
2(b) O
of O
the O
Agreement O
is O
an O
unenforceable O
penalty. O
We O
review O
the O
issue O
de O

(2000) O
. O
Schmiege O
and O
Bush O
interpret O
the O
provision O
quite O
differently. O
Schmiege O
maintains O
that O
section O
2(b) O
of O
the O
Agreement O
imposes O
a O
$54 O
, O
000 O
penalty O
for O
missing O
a O
single O
installment O
payment. O
He O
argues O
that O
the O
entry O
of O
judgment O
in O
excess O
of O
three O
times O
the O
settlement O
amount O
for O
making O
a O
single O
late O
payment O
is O
excessive O
and O
unreasonable O
compared O
to O
any O
damages O
Bush O
suffered O
as O
a O
result O
of O
the O
late O
payment. O
On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
Bush O
maintains O
that O
section O
2(b) O
of O
the O
Agreement O
provides O
a O
discount O
to O
Schmiege O
on O
the O
amount O
owed O
(which O
according O
to O
Bush O
is O
$79 O
, O
000) O
so O
long O
as O
Schmiege O
makes O
timely O
payments. O
We O
agree O
with O
Schmiege O
and O
find O
that O
, O
because O
there O
is O
no O
basis O
upon O
which O
to O
conclude O
that O
$79 O
, O
000 O
represents O
a O
reasonable O
approximation O
of O
what O
Bush O
would O
have O
received O
had O
he O
litigated O
the O
matter O
, O
the O
provision O
is O
an O
unenforceable O
penalty O

v. O

F.3d O
309 O
(7th O
Cir. O
2002) O
, O
guides O
our O
resolution O
of O
this O
issue. O
In O
Scavenger O
Sale O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
sued O
the O
defendant O
for O
money O
due O
under O
a O
loan O
agreement. O
The O
district O
court O
granted O
summary O
judgment O
for O
the O
plaintiff O
, O
leaving O
open O
the O
final O
calculation O
of O
the O
unpaid O
balance. O
Thereafter O
, O
the O
parties O
settled O
their O
differences O
and O
agreed O
that O
the O
amount O
due O
was O
$1.6 O
million. O
They O
further O
agreed O
that O
the O
court O
would O
enter O
judgment O
in O
that O
amount O
plus O
15% O
interest O
unless O
the O
defendant O
promptly O
paid O
$1 O
million O
plus O
12% O
interest. O
After O
the O
defendant O
made O
payments O
totaling O
$750 O
, O
000 O
, O
he O
stopped O
making O
payments. O
The O
plaintiff O
asked O
the O
court O
to O
enter O
judgment O
for O
$1.6 O
million O
as O
provided O
in O
the O
settlement O
agreement. O
The O
court O
rejected O
the O
plaintiffs O
request O
, O
and O
it O
instead O
entered O
judgment O
for O
$1 O
million O
, O
less O
payments O
previously O
made. O
The O
court O
concluded O
that O
an O
obligation O
to O
pay O
$1.6 O
million O
based O
on O
a O
failure O
to O
pay O
$1 O
million O
would O
result O
in O
a O
$600 O
, O
000 O
\u201cpenalty.\u201d O

The O
plaintiff O
appealed O
. O
On O
appeal O
, O
the O
Seventh O
Circuit O
rejected O
the O
district O
court\u2019s O
conclusion O
that O
the O
$600 O
, O
000 O
was O
a O
penalty. O
Rather O
, O
it O
characterized O
the O
$1 O
million O
option O
as O
a O
\u201c O
\u2018discount\u2019 O
\u201d O
for O
prompt O
payment. O
Scavenger O
Sale O
, O
288 O
F.3d O
at O
311. O
It O
stated: O
\u201cEverything O
depends O
on O
which O
end O
of O
the O
telescope O
one O
looks O
*509through. O
In O
contract O
law O
a O
\u2018penalty\u2019 O
is O
a O
payment O
that O
exceeds O
a O
reasonable O
estimate O
of O
the O
loss O
from O
breach. O
[Citation.] O
Determining O
whether O
a O
liquidated-damages O
clause O
is O
a O
penalty O
can O
be O
hard O
for O
the O
same O
reason O
the O
parties O
thought O
it O
hard O
to O
calculate O
actual O
damages O
in O
the O
first O
place: O
what\u2019s O
the O
benchmark O
against O
which O
the O
stipulated O
damages O
will O
be O
compared O
to O
determine O
whether O
they O
are O
a O
penalty? O
Here O
the O
magistrate O
judge O
used O
$1 O
million O
as O
the O
benchmark O
, O
but O
this O
amounts O
to O
saying O
that O
all O
settlements O
entail O
penalties O
, O
because O
parties O
resolve O
their O
dispute O
for O
some O
fraction O
of O
the O
original O
claim. O
Parties O
settle O
litigation O
with O
the O
expectation O
that O
, O
if O
the O
deal O
falls O
through O
, O
each O
side O
retains O
its O
legal O
entitlements. O
A O
judgment O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
original O
legal O
entitlement O
can\u2019t O
be O
called O
a O
\u2018penalty\u2019 O
for O
the O
collapse O
of O
the O
settlement; O
it O
is O
instead O
the O
non-penalty O
benchmark.\u201d O
(Emphasis O
in O
original.) O
Scavenger O
Sale O
, O
288 O
F.3d O
at O
311 O
. O
The O
court O
elaborated O
further O
, O
stating: O
\u201c[N]o O
sum O
less O
than O
or O
equal O
to O
the O
judgment O
that O
would O
be O
entered O
following O
a O
trial O
may O
be O
called O
a O
\u2018penalty.\u2019 O
The O
outcome O
of O
litigation O
is O
the O
lawful O
benchmark. O
Any O
lower O
settlement O
is O
a O
discount O
, O
and O
to O
insist O
that O
the O
full O
amount O
(that O
is O
, O
the O
probable O
judgment) O
be O
paid O
if O
the O
settlement O
falls O
through O
is O
not O
to O
insist O
on O
or O
collect O
a O
\u2018penalty\u2019 O
by O
comparison O
to O
the O
party\u2019s O
original O
legal O
entitlements.\u201d O

The O
court O
summarized O
the O
issue O
as O
follows: O
\u201cIn O
contract O
law O
a O
court O
asks O
whether O
liquidated O
damages O
reasonably O
approximate O
the O
actual O
damages O
from O

in O

cases O
we O
ask O
whether O
the O
full O
payment O
provided O
in O
the O
event O
the O
settlement O
falls O
through O
reasonably O
approximates O
the O
damages O
that O
the O
court O
was O
likely O
to O
provide O
had O
the O
case O
been O
litigated O
to O
conclusion.\u201d O
Scavenger O
Sale O
, O
288 O
F.3d O
at O
312 O
. O
The O
court O
found O
that O
the O
$600 O
, O
000 O
payment O
was O
not O
a O
penalty O
because O
the O
original O
amount O
owed O
, O
$1.6 O
million O
, O
provided O
the O
benchmark O
to O
measure O
the O
reasonableness O
of O
the O
sum. O
Scavenger O
Sale O
, O
288 O
F.3d O
at O
312 O
. O
Bush O
contends O
that O
Scavenger O
Sale O
supports O
his O
argument O
that O
the O
modification O
of O
the O
settlement O
amount O
from O
$25 O
, O
000 O
to O
$79 O
, O
000 O
is O
not O
a O
penalty. O
According O
to O
Bush O
, O
he O
\u201creasonably O
calculated O
his O
damages O
to O
be O
in O
excess O
of O
$300 O
, O
000.00.\u201d O
He O
further O
argues O
that O
during O
the O
mediation O
conference O
he O
\u201coffered O
to O
settle O
the O
matter O
for O
$103 O
, O
000.00 O
, O
\u201d O
and O
, O
when O
the O
offer O
was O
rejected O
by O
Schmiege O
, O
Bush O
\u201cultimately O
accepted O
a O
settlement O
of O
$79 O
, O
000.00 O
in O
the O
event O
Schmiege O
did O
not O
make O
his O
installment O
payments O
of O
$416.66 O
in O
a O
timely O
fashion.\u201d O
However O
, O
Bush O
has O
not O
cited O
anything O
to O
support O
his O
bare O
assertions O
as O
to O
the O
amount O
of O
\u201cactual O
damages.\u201d O
In O
any O
event O
, O
the O
question O
is O
*510not O
what O
Bush O
had O
estimated O
his O
damages O
to O
be; O
the O
question O
is O
what O
amount O
the O
court O
likely O
would O
have O
awarded O
had O
the O
case O
been O
litigated. O
See O
Scavenger O

Here O

there O
is O

would O
have O

That O
fact O

this O

the O

the O

plaintiff O
had O
a O
claim O
for O
$1.6 O

the O
agreed O
value O
of O
the O
note. O
There O
was O
no O
question O
that O
, O
had O
the O

litigated O
, O
the O

would O
have O
been O
entitled O

at O

Bush\u2019s O
bare O
assertion O
that O
his O
claim O
was O
worth O
in O
excess O
of O
$300 O
, O
000 O
does O
not O
make O
it O
so. O
Unlike O
in O
Scavenger O
Sale O
, O
the O
court O
made O
no O
finding O
in O
Bush\u2019s O
favor O
, O
and O
the O
Agreement O
did O
not O
express O
, O
as O
it O
easily O
could O
have O
, O
what O
Bush\u2019s O
claim O
was O
worth. O
Indeed O
, O
Schmiege O
could O
argue O
that O
Bush\u2019s O
claim O
was O
worth O
nothing O
and O
that O
he O
(Schmiege) O
chose O
to O
settle O
the O
matter O
for O
$25 O
, O
000 O
to O
save O
himself O
the O
aggravation O
and O
cost O
of O
litigating O
the O
matter. O
There O
is O
simply O
nothing O
in O
the O
record O
to O
show O
what O
, O
if O
anything O
, O
the O
court O
would O
have O
awarded O
had O
the O
matter O
been O
litigated. O
Accordingly O
, O
as O
there O
is O
no O
basis O
for O
finding O
the O
provision O
reasonable O
, O
we O
find O
that O
the O
provision O
is O
an O
unenforceable O
penalty O
. O
Based O
on O
our O
resolution O
of O
the O
above O

, O
we O
need O
not O
address O
whether O
Bush\u2019s O
acceptance O
of O
the O
missed O
monthly O
payment O
and O
subsequent O

waived O
Schmiege\u2019s O

History O
In O
July O

, O
Blakey O
pleaded O
guilty O
in O
Sangamon O
County O
circuit O
court O
to O
predatory O
criminal O
sexual O

, O
and O
the O

Blakey O
, O
No. O
98\u2014CF\u2014571 O
(Sangamon O
County O
, O
July O
1999). O
Blakey O
, O
age O
32 O
in O
1999 O
, O
molested O
three O
family O
members O
who O
were O
under O
the O
age O
of O
13. O
While O
in O
pretrial O
custody O
, O
Blakey O
bragged O
about O
the O
molestations O
to O
fellow O
inmates O
, O
referring O
to O
himself O
as O
the O
\u201ciceman\u201d O
because O
he O
was O
too O
slick O
to O
get O
caught. O
Blakey O
also O
told O
inmates O
that O
he O
did O
not O
regret O
his O
actions O
and O
that O
he O
planned O
on O
getting O
a O
job O
at O
a O
day O
care O
where O
he O
would O
be O
\u201ca O
lot O
slicker\u201d O
so O
as O
not O
to O
get O
caught O
the O
next O
time. O
Blakey O
continues O
to O
admit O
his O
actions O
and O
has O
recently O
told O
psychiatrists O
that O
, O
over O
the O
years O
, O
he O
has O
molested O
10 O
females O
and O
males O
, O
aged O
2 O
to O
11 O
. O
In O
1999 O
, O
Blakey O
was O
given O
the O
opportunity O
to O
participate O
in O
a O
sex-offender O
treatment O
program O
but O
refused. O
In O
2001 O
, O
Blakey O
agreed O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
program. O
Blakey O
received O
treatment O
in O
the O
program O
from O
2001 O
to O
2003. O
However O
, O
Dr. O
Timothy O
Lawrence O
, O
a O
group O
therapist O
for O
the O
program O
, O
informed O
Blakey\u2019s O
subsequent O
psychiatrist O
that: O
\u201c[Blakey\u2019s] O
emotional O
commitment O
and O
involvement O
in O
[the O
program] O
was O
minimal. O
Progress O
was O
considered O
to O
be O
poor. O
[Blakey] O
was O
clinically O
viewed O
as O
an O
immature O
, O
non[ O
]compliant[ O
] O
participant O
in O
the O
group O
process. O
*** O
[He O
has] O
a O
poor O
prognosis O
for O
community O
adjustment.\u201d O
After O
receiving O
the O
aforementioned O
sex-offender O
treatment O
in O
the O
*549prison O
, O
Blakey O
apparently O
failed O
a O
subsequent O
screening O
process O
and O
was O
referred O
for O
detention O
with O
the O
Department O
of O
Health O
and O
Human O
Services O
. O
In O
March O
2004 O
, O
after O
being O
in O
prison O
for O
less O
than O
five O
years O
, O
the O
State O
filed O
a O
petition O
to O
commit O
respondent O
pursuant O
to O
the O
Sexually O
Violent O
Persons O
Commitment O
Act O
(725 O
ILCS O
207/1 O
through O
99 O
(West O
2004)). O
Following O
a O
mid-2005 O
bench O
trial O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
adjudicated O
Blakey O
a O
sexually O
violent O
person O
and O
committed O
Blakey O
to O
the O
Department O
of O
Health O
and O
Human O
Services O
for O
control O
, O
care O
, O
and O
treatment O
until O
the O
court O
determined O
Blakey O
to O
no O
longer O
be O
a O
sexually O
violent O
person. O
Blakey O
did O
not O
appeal O
the O
adjudication O
. O
On O
March O
17 O
, O
2006 O
, O
Dr. O
Brucker O
performed O
a O
section O
55 O
six-month O
reevaluation O
(725 O
ILCS O
207/55 O
(West O
2006) O
(requiring O
periodic O
reevaluations O
of O
committed O
persons)). O
Dr. O
Brucker O
noted O
that O
Blakey O
had O
stopped O
participating O
in O
the O
\u201cCORE\u201d O
treatment O
program O
and O
failed O
to O
participate O
in O
any O
sex-offender-specific O
treatment O
program O
during O
the O
six-month O
evaluation O
period. O
Instead O
, O
Blakey O
was O
, O
in O
a O
sense O
, O
demoted O
to O
a O
therapy O
program O
entitled O
\u201cPOWER O
to O
Change O
, O
\u201d O
which O
was O
designed O
for O
offenders O
who O
struggled O
in O
the O
sexual-offense-specific O
programs. O
Dr. O
Brucker O
recommended O
that O
Blakey O
continue O
to O
be O
found O
a O
sexually O
violent O
person O
and O
remain O
committed O
to O
a O
secure O
facility O
for O
sex-offender O
treatment O
. O
B. O
The O
Section O
55 O
18-Month O
Reevaluation O
In O
March O
2007 O
, O
Dr. O
Brucker O
performed O
the O
18-month O
reevaluation O
pursuant O
to O
section O
55 O
that O
is O
at O
issue O
in O
the O
instant O
appeal. O
725 O
ILCS O
207/55 O
(West O
2006). O
The O
evaluation O
concluded O
that O
Blakey O
continued O
to O
suffer O
from O
a O
mental O
disorder O
, O
namely O
pedophilia O
(sexually O
attracted O
to O
both O
genders O
, O
nonexclusive O
type) O
, O
combined O
with O
a O
personality O
disorder O
(not O
otherwise O
specified O
, O
with O
antisocial O
traits). O
Dr. O
Brucker O
stated O
that O
\u201cdue O
to O
[Blakey\u2019s] O
mental O
disorders O
, O
it O
[is] O
substantially O
probable O
that O
[Blakey] O
will O
engage O
in O
future O
acts O
of O
sexual O
violence.\u201d O
Dr. O
Brucker O
performed O
several O
psychological O
tests O
on O
Blakey O
, O
which O
revealed O
that O
Blakey O
(1) O
had O
fantasies O
about O
sexually O
touching O
children O
and O
found O
the O
idea O
of O
touching O
children O
to O
be O
slightly O
arousing; O
(2) O
strongly O
disagreed O
with O
the O
statement O
, O
\u201csex O
between O
a O
13-year-old O
(or O
younger) O
child O
and O
an O
adult O
causes O
the O
child O
emotional O
problems\u201d; O
(3) O
demonstrated O
significant O
sexual O
interest O
in O
preschool O
, O
adolescent O
, O
and O
adult O
females; O
and O
(4) O
demonstrated O
significant O
sexual O
interest O
in O
sexual O
stories O
involving O
male O
and O
female O
infants O
, O
male O
(coercive O
and O
persuasive O
storylines) O
and O
female O
(persuasive) O
preschool O
children O
, O
male O
(coercive) O
and O
female O
(coercive O
and O
persuasive) O
grammar-school O
children O
, O
and O
female O
teens O
(persuasive). O
Dr. O
Brucker O
believed O
that O
Blakey O
attempted O
to O
interfere O
with O
response O
patterns O
on O
these O
tests O
in O
9 O
of O
22 O
segments O
. O
*550Since O
the O
last O
evaluation O
, O
Blakey O
continued O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
POWER O
treatment O
program O
, O
but O
still O
had O
not O
participated O
in O
the O
sex-offender-specific O
CORE O
treatment O
program. O
Blakey O
told O
Dr. O
Brucker O
that O
, O
through O
the O
POWER O
program O
, O
he O
had O
improved O
his O
anger-management O
skills O
, O
his O
ability O
to O
analyze O
his O
feelings O
, O
and O
his O
relationships O
with O
other O
residents O
. O
Based O
on O
the O
reevaluation O
, O
Dr. O
Brucker O
recommended O
that O
Blakey O
should O
(1) O
continue O
to O
be O
found O
a O
sexually O
violent O
person O
, O
and O
(2) O
be O
ordered O
to O
conditional O
release O
in O
the O
community O
as O
long O
as O
he O
demonstrates O
a O
willingness O
to O
cooperate O
with O
his O
plan. O
Concurrent O
with O
the O
section O
55 O
reevaluation O
, O
Blakey O
received O
notice O
stating: O
\u201cIf O
you O
do O
not O

have O
made O
enough O
progress O
to O
be O
conditionally O

or O
discharged. O
This O
means O
the O
[c]ourt O
will O
set O
a O

, O
a O

be O
set.\u201d O
Following O
the O
18-month O
reevaluation O
, O
Blakey O
did O
not O
file O
a O
petition O
for O
conditional O
release O
or O
a O
petition O
for O
discharge. O
However O
, O
he O
also O
never O
signed O
a O
waiver O
of O
his O
right O
to O
petition O
for O
conditional O
release O
or O
discharge. O
Because O
Blakey O
did O
not O
sign O
the O

, O
the O

was O
set O
for O
a O

At O
the O

In O
its O

the O

held O
that O

II. O
ANALYSIS O
On O
appeal O
, O
Blakey O
argues O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
erred O
when O
it O
found O
no O
probable O
cause O
to O
warrant O
an O
evidentiary O
hearing O
to O
determine O
whether O
Blakey O
had O
made O
sufficient O
progress O
to O
be O
conditionally O
released O
or O
discharged. O
Blakey O
argues O
that O
, O
under O
section O
65(b)(1) O
, O
the O
court O
may O
only O
consider O
the O
reevaluation O
report O
and O
the O
argument O
of O
both O
parties. O
725 O
ILCS O
207/65(b)(1) O
(West O

Because O
Dr. O
Brucker\u2019s O
reevaluation O
recommendation O
was O
that O
the O
court O
order O
that O
Blakey O
was O
ready O
for O
conditional O
release O
, O
Blakey O
contends O
the O
trial O
court O
abused O
its O
discretion O
in O
declining O
to O
find O
probable O
cause O
to O
proceed O
to O
an O

First O
, O
we O

If O

, O
as O

, O
the O

If O

both O

Blakey O
did O
not O
file O
a O
petition O
for O
conditional O
release. O
And O
, O
unlike O
section O
65 O
, O
section O
60 O
does O
not O
automatically O
provide O
for O
a O
probable-cause O
hearing O
where O
the O
committed O
person O
takes O
no O
action O
following O
a O
section O
55 O
reevaluation. O
Nevertheless O
, O
assuming O
, O
arguendo O
, O
that O
the O
question O
of O
whether O
Blakey O
should O
be O
conditionally O
released O
was O
properly O
before O
the O
trial O
court O
at O
the O
probable-cause O
hearing O
by O
virtue O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
Dr. O
Brucker O
recommended O
a O
conditional O
release O
in O
the O
section O
55 O
reevaluation O
and O
by O
virtue O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
Blakey O
never O
signed O
the O
accompanying O
waiver O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
was O
not O
required O
to O
find O
probable O

\u201cIf O
the O
court O
determines O
at O
the O

that O

exists O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
not O
substantially O
probable O
that O
the O
person O
will O
engage O
in O
acts O
of O
sexual O
violence O
if O
on O
release O
or O
conditional O
release O
, O
the O

set O
[an O

hearing O
on O
the O
issue.\u201d O
725 O
ILCS O
207/60(c) O
(West O
2006) O
. O
Here O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
stated O
that O
nothing O
in O
the O
reevaluation O
report O
supported O
Dr. O
Brucker\u2019s O
surprising O
recommendation O
that O
Blakey O
was O
ready O
for O
conditional O
release O
, O
which O
constituted O
Dr. O
Brucker\u2019s O
final O
sentence O
in O
the O
24-page O
report. O
In O
fact O
, O
just O
a O
few O
paragraphs O
prior O
to O
that O
somewhat O
startling O
recommendation O
, O
Dr. O
Brucker O
specifically O
concluded O
that O
\u201cdue O
to O
[Blakey\u2019s] O
mental O
disorders O
, O
it O
[is] O
substantially O
probable O
that O
[Blakey] O
will O
engage O
in O
future O
acts O
of O
sexual O
violence.\u201d O
This O
language O
mirrors O
the O
standard O
set O
forth O
in O
section O
60(c) O
, O
which O
precludes O
conditional O
release O
under O
such O
circumstances. O
725 O
ILCS O
207/60(c) O
(West O
2006). O
Dr. O
Brucker O
reported O
that O
Blakey O
still O
held O
the O
distorted O
belief O
that O
it O
was O
not O
emotionally O
damaging O
for O
a O
child O
under O
13 O
years O
old O
to O
have O
sex O
with O
an O
adult. O
Additionally O
, O
Dr. O
Brucker O
reported O
that O
Blakey O
had O
not O
yet O
participated O
in O
any O
sex-offender-specific O
treatment O
programs O
, O
making O
it O
difficult O
to O
understand O
why O
Dr. O
Brucker O
would O
recommend O
conditional O
release O
as O
opposed O
to O
continued O
commitment O
in O
a O
secured O
facility O
where O
Blakey O
could O
graduate O
to O
sex-offender-specific O
treatment. O
Aside O
from O
the O
final O
sentence O
of O
Dr. O
Brucker\u2019s O
report O
, O
the O
evidence O
overwhelmingly O
favored O
continued O
commitment O
in O
a O
secured O
facility. O
The O
court O
was O
not O
required O
to O
hold O
a O
further O
evidentiary O
hearing O
on O
the O
matter O
. O

JUSTICE O
O\u2019BRIEN O
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Defendant O
Bennie O
K. O

entered O
a O

guilty O
plea O
to O
possession O
of O

, O

suspended O

The O
court O
sentenced O
defendant O
to O
two O
years\u2019 O
imprisonment O
and O
imposed O
$1 O
, O
240 O
in O
fines O
and O
fees. O
On O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
solely O
asserts O
we O
must O
vacate O
and O
offset O
certain O
fines O
and O
fees O
. O
The O
parties O
stipulated O
that O
the O
State\u2019s O
evidence O
at O
trial O
would O
demonstrate O
that O
at O
3 O
a.m. O
on O
June O
9 O
, O
2006 O
, O
defendant O
was O
driving O
at O
*147102nd O
and O
South O
Ridgeland O
Avenue O
in O
Chicago O
Ridge O
when O
an O
officer O
stopped O
him O
for O
a O
traffic O
violation. O
The O
officer O
learned O
that O
defendant\u2019s O
license O
was O
suspended O
and O
a O
custodial O
search O
of O
defendant O
revealed O
0.6 O
grams O
of O
heroin. O
Defendant O
was O
previously O
convicted O
of O
driving O
while O
his O
driver\u2019s O
license O
, O

or O

to O
operate O
a O
motor O
vehicle O
was O
suspended O
or O

on O
July O
31 O
, O

. O
The O
court O
sentenced O
defendant O
to O
two O
years\u2019 O
imprisonment O
and O
assessed O
$1 O
, O
240 O
in O
fines O
and O

The O
mittimus O
also O
indicates O
that O
defendant O
was O
entitled O
to O
102 O
days O
of O
presentencing O

. O
On O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
first O
asserts O
the O
court O
improperly O
assessed O
the O
$20 O
preliminary O
hearing O
fee O
against O
him O
because O
no O
preliminary O
hearing O
occurred O
within O
the O
meaning O
of O
section O

\u2014 O
2002.1(a) O
of O
the O
Counties O
Code O
(55 O
ILCS O
5/4 O
\u2014 O
2002.1(a) O
(West O
2006)) O
. O
Although O
the O
mittimus O
describes O
this O
assessment O
as O
a O
\u201cpreliminary O
hearing\u201d O
fee O
, O
section O
4 O
\u2014 O
2002.1(a) O
states O
, O
in O
pertinent O
part O
, O
that O
the O
\u201cState\u2019s O
attorneys O
shall O
be O
entitled O
to O
the O
following O
fees[:] O
*** O
For O

$20.\u201d O
55 O
ILCS O
5/4 O
\u2014 O
2002.1(a) O
(West O
2006). O
The O
parties O
dispute O
the O
meaning O
of O
\u201cpreliminary O
examination O
, O
\u201d O
which O
is O
not O
defined O
in O
the O
Counties O
Code O
. O
The O
well-established O
principles O
of O
statutory O
construction O
mandate O
that O
all O
language O
used O
in O
a O
statute O
be O
given O
effect O
and O
that O
no O
word O
, O
clause O
or O
sentence O
be O
rendered O
meaningless O
, O
superfluous O
or O
insignificant. O
E.g. O
, O
People O
v. O

, O

(2002); O

Barrett O
v. O
Barrett O
, O
31 O
Ill. O
2d O
360 O
, O
364-65 O
(1964). O
In O
light O
of O
these O
principles O
, O
we O
cannot O
exclude O
the O
language O
\u201cheld O
to O
bail O
or O
recognizance\u201d O
from O
section O
4 O
\u2014 O
2002.1(a) O
, O
which O
authorizes O
the O
$20 O
fee O
in O
this O
case. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
find O
that O
as O
used O
in O
section O
4 O
\u2014 O
2002.1(a) O
, O
a O
\u201cpreliminary O
examination\u201d O
means O
the O
proceedings O
at O
which O
a O
trial O
court O
examines O
relevant O
factors O
for O
the O
purpose O
of O
determining O
whether O
or O
not O
to O
hold O
defendant O
on O
bail O
or O
recognizance. O
Here O
, O
there O
can O
be O
no O
dispute O
that O
a O
bail O
hearing O
was O
held O
because O
the O
transcript O
of O
it O
is O
in O
the O
record O
on O
appeal O
, O
and O
therefore O
, O
the O
court O
properly O
assessed O
the O
$20 O
fee O
. O
To O
employ O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure O
of O
1963 O
(725 O
ILCS O
5/100 O
\u2014 O
1 O
et O
seq. O
(West O
2006)) O
to O
define O
\u201cpreliminary O
examination\u201d O
as O
a O
probable O
cause O
hearing O
, O
as O
urged O
by O
defendant O
, O
ignores O
the O
\u201cbail O
or O
recognizance\u201d O
language O
in O
the O
relevant O
statute. O
To O
the O
extent O
*148defendant O
reads O
the O
statute O
as O
meaning O
a O
defendant O
who O
is O
held O
to O
bail O
or O
recognizance O
, O
such O
interpretation O
does O
not O
withstand O
scrutiny O
because O
a O
probable O
cause O
hearing O
does O
not O
distinguish O
between O
a O
defendant O
who O
is O
in O
or O
out O
of O
custody. O
We O
also O
observe O
that O
if O
this O
term O
was O
intended O
to O
be O
defined O
as O
in O
the O
Code O
of O
Criminal O
Procedure O
, O
the O
statute O
could O
have O
referred O
to O
the O
definition O
in O
the O
Code O
, O
particularly O
in O
light O
of O
the O
statute\u2019s O
reference O
to O
another O
code O
to O
define O
a O
different O
term O
within O
the O
statute. O

(West O

(cross-references O

Because O
a O
hearing O
was O
held O
on O
defendant\u2019s O
bail O
, O
the O
court O
properly O
assessed O
the O
$20 O
fee O
. O
Next O
, O
defendant O
asserts O
and O
the O
State O
correctly O
concedes O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
improperly O
ordered O
him O
to O
pay O
the O
$20 O
fine O
pursuant O
to O
the O
Act O
because O
the O
court O
had O
also O
imposed O

may O
be O
fined O
$20 O

when O

other O
fine O
is O
imposed.\u201d O

In O

Thus O

Finally O

and O
vacating O
its O

On O
appeal O
, O
plaintiff O
contends O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
erred O
in O
vacating O
its O
ex O

default O
judgment O
and O
award O
where O
plaintiff O
properly O
served O
defendant O
substitute O
process O
through O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State. O
Based O
on O
the O
following O
, O
we O
affirm O
. O
In O
late O
June O
and O
early O
July O
2005 O
, O
plaintiff O
and O
defendant O
, O
through O
their O
attorneys O
, O
corresponded O
regarding O
money O
that O
defendant O
allegedly O
owed O
plaintiff O
for O
merchandise. O
Plaintiffs O
attorney O
apparently O
initiated O
the O
communications O
by O
requesting O
the O
outstanding O
money. O
On O
July O

, O
2005 O
, O
defendant\u2019s O
attorney O
responded O
, O
requesting O
documentation O
to O
support O
plaintiffs O
purported O
claim O
. O
Then O
, O
on O
July O
14 O
, O
2005 O
, O
plaintiff O
filed O
a O

of O
contract O
action O
seeking O
to O
collect O
the O
$78 O
, O
692.80 O
allegedly O
owed O

In O

, O
the O
sheriff O
filed O
his O

with O
the O
clerk O
of O
the O

*111On O
September O

, O

, O
defendant\u2019s O

sent O
a O
second O
letter O
to O
plaintiffs O
attorney O
requesting O
documentation O
to O
support O
plaintiff\u2019s O
purported O
claim. O
In O
the O
letter O
, O
defendant\u2019s O
attorney O
asserted: O
\u201cAs O
you O
know O
, O
compliance O
with O
my O
client\u2019s O
request O
is O
a O
precondition O
to O
[plaintiff] O
taking O
any O
legal O
action O
against O
my O
client O
and O
any O
lawsuit O
filed O
prior O
to O
compliance O
would O
be O
a O
violation O
of O
my O
client\u2019s O
rights.\u201d O
That O
same O
day O
, O
plaintiffs O
counsel O
obtained O
leave O
of O
the O
court O
to O
issue O
an O
alias O
summons O
and O
effectively O
serve O

on O
the O
Secretary O

State O
pursuant O
to O
section O
5.25 O
of O
the O
Business O
Corporation O
Act O
of O
1983 O
(Act) O
(805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25 O
(West O
2004)). O
On O
September O
14 O
, O
2005 O
, O
plaintiff O
filed O
an O
affidavit O
of O
compliance O
, O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
alias O
summons O
and O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
complaint O
with O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
and O
mailed O
the O

to O
defendant\u2019s O
registered O
agent O
at O
6817 O
S. O
Harlem O
Avenue O
, O
Bedford O
Park O
, O
Illinois O
. O
Then O
, O
on O
November O
3 O
, O
2005 O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
entered O
an O
ex O
parte O
default O
judgment O
and O
award O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
$78 O
, O
692.80 O
in O
favor O
of O
plaintiff. O
Plaintiff O
subsequently O
filed O
a O
citation O
to O
discover O
assets O
and O
mailed O
the O
notice O
to O
defendant\u2019s O
\u201clast O
known O
address\u201d O
of O
8301 O
S. O
77th O
Avenue O
, O
Bridgeview O
, O
Illinois. O
Thereafter O
, O
defendant\u2019s O
attorney O
filed O
a O
motion O
to O
quash O
service O
of O
process. O
On O
April O
11 O
, O
2006 O
, O
following O
a O
hearing O
, O
1 O
the O
trial O
court O
granted O
defendant\u2019s O
motion O
and O
vacated O
its O
prior O
default O
judgment O
and O
award. O
This O
timely O
appeal O
followed O
. O
Plaintiff O
contends O
that O
it O
properly O
served O
defendant. O
Specifically O
, O
plaintiff O
argues O
that O
it O
complied O
with O
the O
Act O
providing O
for O
substitute O
service O
where O
it O
served O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
after O
having O
exercised O
reasonable O
diligence O
in O
its O
attempt O
to O
first O
serve O
defendant\u2019s O
registered O
agent. O
Defendant O
responds O
that O
plaintiff O
failed O
to O
comply O
with O
all O
of O
the O
Act\u2019s O
requirements O
. O
Pursuant O
to O
section O
5.25 O
of O
the O
Act O
, O
service O
of O
process O
may O
be O
made O
upon O
a O
corporation\u2019s O
registered O
agent O
or O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State. O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(a) O
(West O
2004). O
However O
, O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
becomes O
irrevocably O
appointed O
as O
a O
corporation\u2019s O
agent O
when O
\u201cthe O
corporation\u2019s O
registered O
agent O
cannot O
with O
reasonable O
diligence O
be O
found O
at O
the O
registered O
office.\u201d O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(b)(2) O
(West O
2004). O
In O
order O
to O
effectuate O
service O
, O
the O
complainant O
must O
provide O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
with O
a O
copy O
of O
the O
process O
, O
the O
notice O
or O
demand O
and O
any O
other O
required O
documents O
, O
along O
with O
an O
affidavit O
of O
compliance O
, O
and O
send O
the O
same O
by O
registered O
or O
certified O
mail O
to O
the O
corporation O
being O
served O
at O
both O
the O
last O
registered O

on O

and O
\u201c[a]t O
such O
address O
the O
use O
of O
which O
the O
person O
instituting O
the O
action O
*** O
knows O
or O
, O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
reasonable O
inquiry O
, O
has O
reason O
to O
believe O
, O
is O
most O
likely O
to O
result O
in O
actual O
notice.\u201d O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(c)(2)(ii) O
(West O
2004) O
. O
In O
the O
case O
at O
bar O
, O
plaintiff O
does O
not O
dispute O
that O
it O
merely O
sent O
substitute O
service O
to O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
and O
defendant\u2019s O
registered O
address. O
Consequently O
, O
plaintiff O
failed O
to O
comply O
with O
all O
of O
the O
requirements O
of O
section O
5.25(c) O
of O
the O
Act. O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(c) O
(West O
2004). O
More O
specifically O
, O
plaintiff O
failed O
to O
send O
the O
requisite O
documents O
to O
an O
address O
which O
it O
knew O
or O
, O
\u201con O
the O
basis O
of O
reasonable O
inquiry O
, O
\u201d O
had O
reason O
to O
believe O
would O
likely O
result O
in O
defendant\u2019s O
notice. O
See O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(c)(2)(ii) O
(West O
2004). O
Plaintiff O
was O
notified O
that O
defendant\u2019s O
office O
moved O
when O
the O
sheriff O
initially O
returned O
service O
with O
a O
notation O
acknowledging O
defendant\u2019s O
new O
address. O
As O
a O
result O
, O
plaintiff O
knew O
or O
with O
reasonable O
inquiry O
, O
i.e. O
, O
reviewing O
the O
sheriff\u2019s O
return O
service O
, O
should O
have O
been O
aware O
of O
the O
address O
where O
defendant O
could O
likely O
be O
notified O
of O
the O
underlying O
lawsuit. O
Notably O
, O
plaintiff O
had O
no O
problem O
using O
defendant\u2019s O
new O
address O
when O
it O
attempted O
to O
collect O
its O
award O
following O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
ex O
parte O
default O
judgment O
. O
We O
are O
not O
persuaded O
by O
plaintiffs O
argument O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
impermissibly O
expanded O
the O
\u201creasonable O
diligence\u201d O
requirement O
of O
the O
Act O
, O
and O
we O
find O
plaintiffs O
reliance O
on O
Dutch O
Farm O
Meats O
, O
Inc. O
v. O
Horizon O
Foods O
, O
Inc. O
, O
275 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
322 O
(1995) O
, O
to O
be O
misplaced. O
As O
a O
threshold O
matter O
, O
an O
appellant O
has O
the O
burden O
to O
present O
a O
sufficiently O
complete O
record O
of O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
proceedings O
to O
support O
any O
claim O
of O
error O
, O
and O
, O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
such O
, O
this O
court O
presumes O
that O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
order O
conformed O
with O
the O
law O
and O
was O
supported O
by O
a O
sufficient O
factual O
basis. O
Foutch O
v. O
O\u2019Bryant O
, O
99 O
Ill. O
2d O
389 O
, O
391-92 O
(1984). O
Plaintiff O
failed O
to O
provide O
this O
court O
with O
a O
report O
of O
the O
trial O
court\u2019s O
proceeding O
or O
an O
acceptable O
substitute O
(see O
210 O
Ill. O
2d O
R. O
323); O
therefore O
, O
we O
presume O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
properly O
applied O
the O
service O
of O
process O
statute O
to O
the O
facts O
of O
this O
case O
. O
We O
additionally O
determine O
that O
plaintiffs O
argument O
is O
misinformed. O
We O
agree O
that O
the O
reasonable O
diligence O
element O
of O
section O
5.25(b)(2) O
of O
the O
Act O
does O
not O
require O
a O
complainant O
to O
seek O
out O
a O
corporation\u2019s O
new O
location O
once O
it O
is O
discovered O
that O
the O
registered O
address O
was O
not O
updated. O
See O
Dutch O
Farm O
Meats O
, O
Inc. O
, O
275 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
326; O
see O
also O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(b)(2) O
(West O
2004). O
However O
, O
in O
order O
to O
comply O
with O
all O
of O
the O
requirements O
of O
the O
substitute O
service O
statute O
, O
a O
complainant O
must O
also O
reasonably O
inquire O
into O
the O
address O
where O
the O
defendant O
will O
likely O
receive O
notice. O
See O
805 O
ILCS O
5/5.25(c)(2)(ii) O
(West O
2004). O
The O
instant O
case O
is O
therefore O
distinguishable O
from O
Dutch O
Farm O
Meats O
, O
Inc. O
, O
where O
the O
plaintiff O
sent O
a O
copy O
of O
a O
summons O
, O
complaint O
*113and O
an O
affidavit O
of O
compliance O
for O
service O
on O
the O
Secretary O
of O
State O
to O
both O
the O
registered O
agent O
at O
the O
registered O
address O
and O
to O
the O
president O
of O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
company O
, O
which O
was O
subsequently O
signed O
as O
received O
by O
the O
president\u2019s O
wife. O
Dutch O
Farm O
Meats O
, O
Inc. O
, O
275 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
324. O
Moreover O
, O
unlike O
in O
Dutch O
Farm O
Meats O
, O
Inc. O
, O
the O
instant O
record O
demonstrates O
that O
defendant O
was O
unaware O
of O
the O
underlying O
lawsuit O
prior O
to O
entry O
of O
the O
ex O
parte O
default O
judgment O
, O
as O
evidenced O
by O
its O
attorney\u2019s O
September O
1 O
, O
2005 O
, O
letter O
notifying O
plaintiffs O
attorney O
that O
institution O
of O
any O
lawsuit O
would O
be O
premature O
and O
a O
violation O
of O
defendant\u2019s O
rights. O
Cf. O
Dutch O
Farm O
Meats O
, O
Inc. O
, O
275 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
328 O
(nothing O
in O
the O
record O
indicated O
that O
the O
president O
of O
the O
plaintiffs O
corporation O
was O
unaware O
of O
the O
lawsuit O
when O
the O
default O
judgment O
was O
entered). O
Consequently O
, O
we O
find O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
properly O
granted O
defendant\u2019s O
motion O
to O
quash O
substitute O
service O
of O
process O
and O
vacated O
its O
ex O

default O
judgment O
and O

. O
Accordingly O
, O
we O
affirm O
the O
judgment O
of O
the O

of O

Affirmed O

the O

At O

We O
conclude O
that O

we O

Both O
judgments O
of O

entered O
by O
the O

mirror O
, O
in O
large O
part O
, O
the O
statute\u2019s O
language O
as O
to O
the O
distribution O
of O
the O

proceeds O
. O
According O
to O
Cardunal O
, O
section O
15 O
\u2014 O
1512(b) O
anticipates O
and O
provides O
for O
the O
payment O
of O
real O
estate O
taxes O
as O
a O
cost O
of O
sale O
, O
and O
thus O
the O
issue O
of O
whether O
real O
estate O
taxes O
should O
be O
paid O
from O
the O
surplus O
was O
properly O
before O
the O
court. O
While O
we O
agree O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
had O
jurisdiction O
to O
rule O
on O
Cardunal\u2019s O
request O
for O
real O
estate O
taxes O
, O
section O
15 O
\u2014 O
1512(b) O
does O
not O
support O
Cardunal\u2019s O
position. O
The O
statute O
states O
that O
proceeds O
shall O
be O
paid O
for O
the O
\u201creasonable O
expenses O
incurred O
of O
securing O
possession O
before O
sale\u201d O
and O
\u201cholding O
, O
maintaining O
, O
and O
preparing O
the O
real O

for O

including O
payment O
of O

735 O
ILCS O
5/15 O
\u2014 O
1512(a) O
, O
(b) O
(West O
2004). O
Thus O
, O
the O
statute O
contemplates O
reimbursement O
for O
taxes O
paid O
on O
the O
property O
before O
the O
foreclosure O
sale O
, O
presumably O
by O
the O
mortgagee. O
Here O
, O
in O
contrast O
, O
Cardunal O
sought O
funds O
to O
pay O
real O
estate O
taxes O
after O
it O
purchased O
the O
property O
. O
Cardunal O
additionally O
argues O
that O
Strandell O
constructively O
acted O
as O
the O
receiver O
for O
the O
property O
, O
because O
the O
trial O
court O
did O
not O
appoint O
an O
independent O
receiver O
and O
Strandell O
remained O
in O
possession O
of O
the O
property O
during O
the O
foreclosure O
action. O
According O
to O
Cardunal O
, O
section O
15 O
\u2014 O
1704(b)(5) O
of O
the O
Foreclosure O
Law O
(735 O
ILCS O
5/15 O
\u2014 O
1704(b)(5) O
(West O
2004)) O
mandates O
that O
a O
receiver O
pay O
real O
estate O
taxes. O
We O
note O
that O
rather O
than O
requiring O
a O
receiver O
to O
pay O
taxes O
, O
section O
15 O
\u2014 O
1704(b) O
actually O
states O
that O
\u201ca O

shall O

Also O
, O

that O

On O
August O
19 O
, O
2002 O
, O
the O
plaintiffs O
filed O
a O
class O
action O
complaint O
against O
the O
defendants. O
The O
complaint O
alleged O
that O
the O
defendants O
were O
engaged O
in O
the O
business O
of O

The O

The O

, O
a O
shipping O
and O
handling O

, O
and O
a O

The O
complaint O
further O
alleged O
that O
all O
the O
allegedly O
excessive O
charges O
had O
been O
paid O
by O
either O
the O
plaintiffs O
or O
their O
respective O
attorneys. O
One O
of O
the O
plaintiffs O
, O
Lorice O
Harris O
, O
alleged O
that O
she O
had O
gone O
to O
the O
hospital O
to O
inspect O
her O
deceased O
husband\u2019s O
medical O
records O
and O
\u201cwas O

and/or O
she O
was O
not O
allowed O
to O
see O
the O
records.\u201d O
None O
of O
the O
other O
plaintiffs O
alleged O
any O
attempt O
to O
inspect O
or O
copy O
the O
records O
from O
the O
providers O
themselves. O
The O
complaint O
purported O
to O

an O

The O
defendants O
argue O
that O
the O
voluntaiy-payment O
doctrine O
applies O
to O
the O

the O

them O

It O

that O

of O

, O
money O
voluntarily O
paid O
on O
a O

to O
recover O
a O

\u2018The O
reason O
[for] O
the O
rule O
*** O
and O
its O
propriety[ O
] O
are O
quite O
obvious O
when O
applied O
to O
a O
case O
of O
payment O
on O
a O
mere O
demand O
of O
money O
unaccompanied O
with O
any O
power O
or O
authority O
to O
enforce O
such O
demand O
, O
except O
by O
a O
suit O
at O
law. O
In O
such O
case O
, O
if O
the O
party O
would O
resist O
an O
unjust O
demand O
, O
he O
must O
do O
so O
at O
the O
threshold. O
The O
parties O
treat O
with O
each O

on O
equal O

and O
if O
litigation O
is O
intended O
by O
the O
one O
of O
whom O
the O
money O
is O
demanded O
, O
it O
should O
precede O
payment. O
When O
the O
person O
making O
the O
payment O
can O
only O
be O
reached O
by O
a O
proceeding O
at O
law O
, O
he O
is O
bound O
to O
make O
his O
defense O
in O

he O
cannot O
postpone O
the O
litigation O
by O
paying O
the O

in O
silence O

under O
a O
reservation O
of O
the O
right O

There O
is O
no O
question O
from O
the O
pleadings O
that O
the O
plaintiffs O
al*882lege O
they O
paid O
the O
invoices O
without O
protest. O
However O
, O
the O
plaintiffs O
argue O
that O
all O
three O
exceptions O
to O
the O
voluntary-payment O
doctrine O
are O
pleaded O
in O
the O
complaint O
and O
raise O
questions O
of O
fact O
sufficient O
to O
defeat O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
on O
the O
pleadings. O
First O
, O
the O
plaintiffs O
argue O
that O
it O
is O
clear O
from O
the O
allegations O
of O
the O
complaint O
that O
they O
paid O
the O
money O
under O
a O
mistake O
of O
fact O
because O
they O
allege O
the O
invoices O
included O
multiple O
charges O
for O
the O
same O
service O
and/or O
charges O
for O
services O
which O
had O
not O
been O
provided O
at O
all O
and O
the O
plaintiffs O
did O
not O
realize O
they O
were O
being O
overcharged. O
The O
plaintiffs O
also O
use O
these O
allegations O
to O
argue O
that O
they O
sufficiently O
pleaded O
fraud O
as O
an O
exception O
to O
the O
voluntary-payment O
doctrine O
. O
We O
find O
the O
plaintiffs\u2019 O
arguments O
unpersuasive. O
The O
plaintiffs\u2019 O
argument O
is O
analogous O
to O
that O
of O
the O
plaintiff O
in O
Goldstein O
Oil O
Co. O
v. O
County O
of O
Cook O
, O
156 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
180 O
(1987). O
In O
that O
case O
, O
the O
plaintiff O
argued O
that O
it O
had O
properly O
pleaded O
the O
absence O
of O
knowledge O
with O
which O
to O
formulate O
a O
protest O
to O
the O
voluntary O
payment O
of O
a O
tax. O
Goldstein O
Oil O
Co. O
, O
156 O
Ill. O

3d O
at O

The O
court O
found O
that O
the O
facts O
were O
not O
obscured O
or O
inaccessible O
but O
, O
rather O
, O
that O
the O
plaintiffs O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
could O
be O
attributed O
to O
its O
lack O
of O
investigation O
into O
the O
defendant\u2019s O
claim O
of O
liability O
and O
the O
basis O
upon O
which O
the O
defendant O
was O
seeking O
the O
tax. O
Goldstein O
Oil O
Co. O
, O
156 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
185. O
The O
court O
reasoned O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
did O
not O
allege O
that O
it O
had O
attempted O
to O
ascertain O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
tax O
but O
was O
unable O
to O
do O
so O
, O
and O
the O
record O
did O
not O
show O
that O
the O
plaintiff O
had O
made O
any O
effort O
to O
obtain O
the O
relevant O
information O
needed O
to O
form O
a O
protest. O
Goldstein O
Oil O
Co. O
, O
156 O
Ill. O

3d O
at O

The O
court O
concluded O
that O
it O
is O
no O
exception O
to O
the O
voluntary-payment O
doctrine O
when O
the O
plaintiff O
makes O
no O
effort O
to O
ascertain O
the O
factual O
basis O
of O
the O
tax O
but O
pays O
it O
anyway. O
Goldstein O

Ill. O
App. O
3d O
at O
186 O
. O
As O
in O
Goldstein O
Oil O
Co. O
, O
the O
plaintiffs O
did O
not O
allege O
that O
they O
made O
any O
effort O
to O
discover O
the O
exact O
nature O
of O
the O
fees O
charged. O
The O
invoices O
described O
what O
the O
defendants O
purported O
to O
charge O
for O
and O
the O
amount O
of O
all O
the O
charges. O
The O
ChartOne O
invoices O
contained O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
\u201cclerical O
fee O
, O
\u201d O
a O
charge O
per O
page O
, O
and O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
shipping O
fee. O
The O
Smart O
Corp. O
invoices O
contained O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
\u201cbasic O
fee O
, O
\u201d O
a O
charge O
for O
a O
\u201cretrieval O

a O
charge O
per O
page O
, O
a O
shipping O
and O
handling O
charge O
, O
and O
a O
sales O
tax O
charge. O
We O
conclude O
that O
the O
plaintiffs O
had O
enough O
information O
to O
determine O
whether O
there O
was O
a O
basis O
to O
protest O
or O
at O
least O
to O
investigate O
the O
exact O
factual O
basis O
for O
the O
charges. O
The O
plaintiffs O
or O
their O
attorneys O
paid O
the O
invoices O
voluntarily O
, O
knowing O
the O
purported O
basis O
for O
the O
charges. O
Furthermore O
, O
there O
is O
no O
allegation O
in O
the O
plaintiffs\u2019 O
complaint O
setting O
forth O
any O
facts O
that O
were O
not O
known O
to O
them O
at O
the O
time O
of O
payment O
and O
that O
they O
later O
discovered. O
*883Therefore O
, O
the O
plaintiffs O
cannot O
establish O
a O
mistake O
of O
fact O
or O
fraud O
under O
the O
allegations O
of O
their O
complaint O
. O
The O
plaintiffs O
next O
argue O
that O
the O
allegations O
of O
the O
complaint O
were O
sufficient O
to O
establish O
a O
factual O
basis O
for O
the O
duress O
exception O
to O
the O
voluntary-payment O
doctrine. O
In O
order O
to O
defeat O
the O
voluntary-payment O
doctrine O
as O
a O
defense O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
duress O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
show O
not O
only O
that O
the O
claim O
asserted O
was O
unlawful O
but O
also O
that O
the O
payment O
was O
not O
voluntary O
because O
there O
was O
some O
necessity O
that O
amounted O
to O
compulsion O
and O
the O
payment O
was O
made O
under O
the O
influence O
of O
that O
compulsion. O

The O
issue O
of O
duress O
and O
compulsory O
payment O
generally O
is O
one O
of O
fact O
to O
be O
judged O
in O

of O

inference O

We O
find O
the O
circuit O

reasoning O
persuasive. O
There O
are O
no O
allegations O
in O
the O
plaintiffs\u2019 O
complaint O
setting O
forth O
any O
effort O
to O
obtain O

Although O

Lorice O

that O

had O
gone O
to O
the O

to O
inspect O
her O
deceased O

of O
the O
Code O
(735 O

required O

Lorice O

did O
not O

or O
that O
she O
waited O
for O
the O
60-day O

does O
not O
allege O
that O

Therefore O
, O
there O

to O
determine O
the O

Shane O
admitted O

Andrew O
returned O
to O
Illinois O
to O
visit O
Shane O
for O
the O
summer. O
Andrew O
then O
returned O
to O
Alaska O
sometime O
in O
mid-August O
2003 O
and O
stayed O
there O
until O
May O
2004 O
, O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
spending O
3x/2 O
weeks O
in O
Illinois O
around O
the O
Christmas O
holidays. O
In O
May O
2004 O
, O
Andrew O
returned O
to O
Illinois O
, O
where O
he O
visited O
Shane O
for O
the O
summer O
. O
On O
June O
23 O
, O
2004 O
, O
Shane O
filed O
a O
petition O
to O
modify O
custody. O
His O
petition O
alleged O
that O
a O
substantial O
change O
of O
circumstances O
had O
occurred O
in O
that O
Andrew O
was O
\u201cscheduled O
to O
begin O
school O
in O
the O
Fall O
of O
2004.\u201d O
The O
petition O
claimed O
that O
once O
school O
started O
, O
\u201cthe O
current O
physical O
custody O
schedule O
will O
be O
impractical O
and O
not O
in O
the O
best O
interest O
of O
[Andrew].\u201d O
Shane O
requested O
that O
the O
parties O
continue O
to O
have O
joint O
custody O
but O
that O
he O
be O
awarded O
primary O
residential O
custody O
and O
that O
Veronica O
be O
awarded O
reasonable O
periods O
of O
visitation O
when O
Andrew O
is O
not O
attending O
school O
. O
On O
November O
19 O
, O
2004 O
, O
Veronica O
responded O
to O
Shane\u2019s O
petition O
by O
filing O
a O
petition O
of O
her O
own. O
Her O
petition O
was O
also O
titled O
as O
a O
petition O
to O
modify O
custody O
and O
was O
identical O
to O
Shane\u2019s O
petition O
in O
every O
aspect O
except O
that O
the O
names O
of O
the O
parties O
had O
been O
changed. O
For O
example O
, O
Veronica\u2019s O
petition O
alleged O
that O
a O
substantial O
change O
in O
circumstances O
had O
occurred O
in O
that O
Andrew O
was O
scheduled O
to O
begin O
school O
in O
the O
fall O
*967of O
2004. O
The O
petition O
further O
alleged O
that O
once O
Andrew O
began O
school O
, O
the O
existing O
visitation O
schedule O
would O
be O
impractical O
and O
not O
in O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
Andrew. O
Finally O
, O
Veronica\u2019s O
petition O
requested O
that O
the O
parties O
continue O
to O
have O
joint O
custody O
but O
that O
she O
be O
awarded O
primary O
residential O
custody O
and O
that O
Shane O
be O
awarded O
reasonable O
periods O
of O
visitation O
when O
Andrew O
is O
not O
attending O
school O
. O
Even O
though O
Veronica\u2019s O
petition O
was O
titled O
as O
a O
petition O
to O
modify O
custody O
, O
she O
was O
already O
the O
primary O
residential O
custodian O
, O
so O
she O
was O
clearly O
not O
seeking O
a O
modification O
of O
custody. O
However O
, O
the O
petition O
did O
ask O
for O
a O
modification O
of O
visitation O
, O
and O
hence O
, O
we O
shall O
treat O
her O
petition O
as O
a O
petition O
for O
a O
modification O
of O
visitation O
and O
refer O
to O
the O
petition O
that O
way O
throughout O
this O
disposition O
. O
On O
May O
25 O
, O
2005 O
, O
a O
bifurcated O
hearing O
on O
the O
parties\u2019 O
pending O
petitions O
began. O
On O
the O
first O
day O
of O
the O
hearing O
, O
Shane O
presented O
evidence O
to O
support O
his O
petition O
to O
modify O
custody. O
The O
evidence O
included O
Shane\u2019s O
testimony O
that O
he O
believed O
that O
a O
substantial O
change O
in O
circumstances O
had O
occurred O
in O
that O
Veronica O
planned O
to O
leave O
the O
military O
and O
move O
to O
Texas O
with O
Andrew. O
Upon O
hearing O
that O
Veronica O
planned O
to O
move O
to O
Texas O
with O
Andrew O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
directed O
Veronica O
to O
file O
a O
petition O
to O
remove. O
The O
hearing O
was O
continued O
to O
June O
29 O
, O
2005. O
On O
May O
27 O
, O
2005 O
, O
Veronica O
filed O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
Andrew O
to O
the O
State O
of O
Texas O
. O
On O
June O
29 O
, O
2005 O
, O
the O
hearing O
reconvened. O
Prior O
to O
hearing O
any O
evidence O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
asked O
Shane\u2019s O
attorney O
where O
he O
stood O
on O
the O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove. O
Shane\u2019s O
attorney O
responded: O
\u201c[I]t O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
\u2014 O
that O
once O
[Veronica] O
took O
the O
child O
out O
of O
\u2014 O
out O
of O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
, O
that O
that\u2019s O
deemed O
a O
consent O
by O
my O
client. O
I O
just O
\u2014 O
I\u2019d O
like O
to O
say O
that O
I O
could O
find O
law O
to O
the O
contrary O
, O
but O
I O
could O
not.\u201d O
Veronica\u2019s O
attorney O
then O
informed O
the O
court O
that O
the O
only O
reason O
she O
filed O
the O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
was O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
had O
requested O
her O
to O
do O
so O
in O
order O
to O
ensure O
that O
all O
her O
pleadings O
were O
in O
order. O
She O
continued: O
\u201cMy O
feeling O
is O
the O
same O
as O
[Shane\u2019s O
attorney] O
, O
that O
it O
is O
not O
a O
necessary O
pleading O
, O
but O
*** O
in O
case O
[the O
circuit O
court] O
disagree O
[s] O
or O
the O
Appellate O
Court O
would O
disagree O
, O
I O
intend O
to O
prove O
my O
case O
on O
the O
Leave O
to O
Remove O
because O
\u2014 O
since O
there\u2019s O
a O
lesser O
burden O
for O
that O
than O
the O
custody O
, O
I O
was O
going O
to O
go O
ahead O
and O
do O
it. O
Not O
because O
I O
necessarily O
think O
I O
have O
to O
, O
but O
just O
in O
case O
somebody O
else O
feels O
that O
way O
***.\u201d O
The O
circuit O
court O
then O
heard O
Veronica\u2019s O
evidence O
and O
both O
sides O
rested O
. O
On O
August O
19 O
, O
2005 O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
delivered O
a O
29-page O
handwritten O
order. O
In O
its O
order O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
found O
, O
\u201c[Njeither O
the O
Petitioner O
nor O
the O
Respondent O
has O
proven O
by O
clear O
and O
convincing O
evidence O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
facts O
that O
have O
arisen O
since O
the O
prior O
orders O
of O
*968the O
Court[ O
] O
that O
a O
modification O
of O
custody O
is O
necessary O
to O
serve O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
[Andrew].\u201d O
The O
circuit O
court O
denied O
both O
petitions O
to O
modify O
and O
ruled O
that O
the O
parties O
should O
continue O
with O
the O
joint O
custody O
of O
Andrew O
, O
while O
Veronica O
remained O
the O
primary O
residential O
custodian O
. O
The O
circuit O
court O
then O
turned O
to O
the O
petition O
to O
remove. O
The O
circuit O
court O
noted O
that O
Veronica O
sought O
leave O
to O
remove O
Andrew O
from O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
to O
the O
State O
of O
Texas. O
The O
circuit O
court O
noted O
that O
Veronica O
had O
the O
burden O
of O
proving O
that O
a O
removal O
from O
Illinois O
would O
be O
in O
Andrew\u2019s O
best O
interests. O
The O
circuit O
court O
then O
found O
that O
when O
the O
parties O
entered O
into O
the O
joint-parenting O
agreement O
, O
they O
both O
anticipated O
that O
they O
would O
\u201cplay O
an O
active O
role O
in O
the O
daily O
life O
of O
their O
son.\u201d O
The O
circuit O
court O
found O
that O
to O
allow O
Veronica O
to O
move O
with O
Andrew O
to O
Texas O
would O
\u201cinterfere O
[with] O
and O
disrupt O
the O
ability O
of O
[Shane] O
to O
have O
involvement O
and O
visitation O
with O
[Andrew] O
on O
a O
regular O
basis.\u201d O
The O
circuit O
court O
referenced O
section O
609 O
of O
the O
Illinois O
Marriage O
and O
Dissolution O
of O
Marriage O
Act O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/609 O
(West O
2004)) O
and O
analyzed O
the O
evidence O
presented O
in O
light O
of O
the O
factors O
set O
forth O
in O
In O
re O
Marriage O
of O
Eckert O
, O
119 O
Ill. O
2d O
316 O
(1988). O
The O
circuit O
court O
found O
that O
Veronica O
had O
failed O
to O
prove O
that O
a O
removal O
from O
Illinois O
would O
be O
in O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
Andrew. O
The O
circuit O
court O
then O
concluded O
that O
it O
would O
be O
in O
the O
best O
interests O
of O
Andrew O
for O
his O
physical O
custody O
to O
remain O
in O
the O
Belleville O
area O
, O
where O
he O
would O
be O
in O
his O
familiar O
surroundings O
, O
attend O
the O
same O
school O
, O
and O
be O
allowed O
to O
have O
regular O
contact O
and O
involvement O
with O
Shane. O
Accordingly O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
denied O
the O
petition O
to O
remove O
. O
The O
circuit O
court O
then O
proceeded O
to O
modify O
the O
visitation O
schedule. O
In O
so O
doing O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
modified O
visitation O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
Shane O
was O
awarded O
visitation O
on O
the O
first O
, O
third O
, O
and O
fourth O
weekends O
of O
each O
month O
from O
Friday O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
until O
Sunday O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
and O
on O
Tuesdays O
and O
Thursdays O
from O
4 O
p.m. O
until O
7 O
p.m. O
during O
the O
school O
year. O
The O
circuit O
court O
further O
ordered O
that O
during O
the O
summer O
, O
Shane O
would O
have O
visitation O
from O
June O
1 O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
through O
August O
10 O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
but O
that O
, O
during O
this O
period O
, O
Veronica O
would O
have O
visitation O
on O
every O
Wednesday O
from O
4 O
p.m. O
to O
8 O
p.m. O
and O
every O
other O
weekend O
from O
Friday O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
until O
Sunday O
at O
6 O
p.m. O
The O
circuit O
court O
added O
that O
each O
party O
would O
be O
entitled O
to O
14 O
consecutive O
days O
with O
Andrew O
during O
the O
summer. O
Finally O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
ordered O
Veronica O
to O
take O
the O
necessary O
steps O
to O
immediately O
ensure O
that O
Andrew O
was O
enrolled O
in O
school O
for O
the O
2005-2006 O
school O
year O
at O
the O
Washington O
School O
in O
Belle-ville O
, O
Illinois. O
Both O
parties O
appeal O
. O
Issues O
On O
appeal O
, O
Veronica O
raises O
two O
issues. O
The O
first O
issue O
is O
whether O
*969the O
circuit O
court O
had O
the O
authority O
to O
consider O
and O
deny O
her O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove. O
Assuming O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
had O
the O
authority O
to O
deny O
her O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
the O
second O
issue O
is O
whether O
the O
circuit O
court\u2019s O
denial O
of O
the O
petition O
was O
against O
the O
manifest O
weight O
of O
the O
evidence. O
On O
cross-appeal O
, O
Shane O
argues O
that O
the O
circuit O
court\u2019s O
denial O
of O
his O
petition O
to O
modify O
custody O
was O
against O
the O
manifest O
weight O
of O
the O
evidence. O
We O
turn O
first O
to O
the O
removal O
issue O
. O
The O
parties O
in O
this O
case O
were O
never O
married O
, O
and O
hence O
the O
issues O
are O
controlled O
by O
the O
Parentage O
Act O
(750 O
ILCS O
45/1 O
et O
seq. O
(West O
2004)). O
All O
actions O
brought O
under O
the O
Parentage O
Act O
are O
statutory O
in O
origin O
, O
and O
the O
circuit O
court\u2019s O
authority O
is O
limited O
to O
that O
granted O
to O
it O
under O
the O
Parentage O
Act. O
In O
re O
Minor O
Child O
Stella O
, O
353 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
415 O
, O
417 O
(2004). O
The O
circuit O
court O
has O
no O
inherent O
power O
under O
the O
Parentage O
Act. O
In O
re O
Minor O
Child O
Stella O
, O
353 O
Ill. O
App. O
3d O
415 O
, O
417 O
(2004) O
. O
In O
the O
instant O
case O
, O
we O
believe O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
erred O
in O
directing O
Veronica O
to O
file O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
in O
considering O
the O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
and O
in O
denying O
the O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove. O
Nothing O
in O
the O
Parentage O
Act O
or O
the O
custody O
provisions O
of O
the O
Illinois O
Marriage O
and O
Dissolution O
of O
Marriage O
Act O
(Marriage O
Act) O
(750 O
ILCS O
5/601 O
et O
seq. O
(West O
2004)) O
requires O
a O
parent O
who O
has O
previously O
removed O
a O
child O
from O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
, O
with O
the O
permission O
of O
the O
court O
, O
to O
seek O
leave O
to O
move O
that O
child O
to O
another O
state. O
Furthermore O
, O
nothing O
in O
the O
Parentage O
Act O
or O
the O
Marriage O
Act O
gives O
the O
court O
the O
authority O
to O
grant O
or O
deny O
leave O
to O
a O
parent O
who O
has O
already O
removed O
a O
child O
from O
the O
State O
of O
Illinois O
to O
move O
that O
child O
to O
another O
state. O
The O
Marriage O
Act O
, O
and O
now O
the O
Parentage O
Act O
through O
a O
2003 O
amendment O
, O
only O
provides O
the O
court O
with O
the O
authority O
to O
grant O
or O
deny O
leave O
to O
remove O
a O
child O
\u201cfrom O
Illinois.\u201d O
750 O
ILCS O
45/16 O
(West O
2004); O
750 O
ILCS O
5/609 O
(West O
2004). O
Accordingly O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
erred O
in O
directing O
Veronica O
to O
file O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
in O
considering O
the O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
and O
in O
denying O
the O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
. O
Next O
, O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
the O
circuit O
court O
considered O
Veronica\u2019s O
petition O
as O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
Andrew O
\u201cfrom O
Illinois O
, O
\u201d O
the O
circuit O
court O
also O
erred. O
Nowhere O
in O
Veronica\u2019s O
petition O
does O
she O
request O
leave O
to O
remove O
Andrew O
\u201cfrom O
Illinois.\u201d O
Furthermore O
, O
Veronica O
had O
already O
removed O
Andrew O
from O
Illinois O
in O
2003 O
with O
the O
court\u2019s O
permission. O
Because O
Veronica O
and O
Andrew O
became O
residents O
of O
Alaska O
and O
because O
the O
Parentage O
Act O
and O
the O
Marriage O
Act O
address O
only O
petitions O
to O
remove O
a O
child O
\u201cfrom O
Illinois O
, O
\u201d O
the O
circuit O
court O
erred O
in O
considering O
the O
petition O
to O
be O
a O
petition O
under O
section O
609 O
of O
the O
Marriage O
Act O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
Andrew O
\u201cfrom O
Illinois.\u201d O
Therefore O
, O
*970because O
the O
circuit O
court O
had O
no O
authority O
to O
direct O
Veronica O
to O
file O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
to O
consider O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
or O
to O
deny O
a O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
, O
we O
vacate O
that O
portion O
of O
the O
circuit O
court\u2019s O
order O
denying O
Veronica\u2019s O
petition O
for O
leave O
to O
remove O
. O
Our O
decision O
in O
the O
instant O
case O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
appellate O
court\u2019s O
decision O
in O
In O
re O
Marriage O
of O

JUSTICE B-A
QUINN I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
The O
plaintiff O
, O
board O
of O
directors O
of O
the O
Warren O
Boulevard O
Condominium O
Association O
, O
filed O
a O
complaint O
in O
forcible O
entry O
and O
detainer O
against O
the O
defendant O
, O
Hilda O
Milton. O
The O
complaint O
alleged O
that O
plaintiff O
was O
entitled O
to O
possession O
of O
a O
certain O
condominium O
unit O
owned O
by O
defendant O
in O
Chicago O
, O
Illinois O
, O
because O
defendant O
failed O
to O
pay O
plaintiff O
$4 O
, O
484 O
in O
assessments O
, O
plus O
all O
rents O
accruing O
through O
date O
of O
trial O
and O
costs O
and O
reasonable O
attorney O
fees O
. O
Defendant O
denied O
that O
payments O
were O
owed O
and O
sought O
a O
jury O
trial. O
Defendant O
also O
requested O
discovery O
of O
certain O
records O
from O
plaintiff. O
Plaintiff O
sought O
compensation O
for O
use O
and O
occupancy O
of O
the O
condominium O
, O
in O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
monthly O
assessment O
of O
$178 O
, O
pending O
the O
outcome O
of O
the O
forcible O
entry O
and O
detainer O
litigation. O
On O
February O
10 O
, O
2009 O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
granted O
plaintiffs O
request O
and O
ordered O
defendant O
to O
pay O
plaintiff O
$178 O
per O
month O
pending O
the O
jury O
trial. O
On O
April O
14 O
, O
2009 O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
denied O
defendant\u2019s O
motion O
to O
reconsider O
and O
applied O
Supreme O
Court O
Rule O
304(a) O
(134 O
Ill. O
2d O
R. O
304(a)) O
language O
to O
its O
use O
and O
occupancy O
judgment. O
Defendant O
now O
appeals. O
Although O
plaintiff O
has O
filed O
no O
brief O
on O
appeal O
, O
we O
will O
consider O
the O
merits O
of O
the O
appeal O

On O
appeal O
, O
defendant O
contends O
that O
the O
circuit O
court\u2019s O
grant O
of O
use O
and O
occupancy O
to O
plaintiff O
, O
pursuant O
to O
the O
Forcible O
Entry O

Detainer O
Act O
(735 O
ILCS O
5/9 O
\u2014 O
101 O
et O
seq. O
(West O

, O
was O
erroneous O
because O
the O
statutory O
provision O
for O
use O
and O
occupancy O
does O
not O
apply O
to O
plaintiffs O
suit O
for O
possession O
of O
the O
condominium O
unit O
based O
on O
the O
owner\u2019s O
failure O
to O
pay O
assessments. O
Because O
the O
question O
of O
the O
proper O
interpretation O
to O
be O
afforded O
statutory O
provisions O
is O
a O
question O
of O

This O

JUSTICE B-A

the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
In O
March O
1990 O
, O
plaintiff O
, O

, O
filed O
this O

against O

Decatur O

In O
her O
complaint O

to O
diagnose O
and O
prevent O
the O
impending O
heart O
attack O
of O
her O
husband O
, O
Richard O
Hoem O
, O
that O
resulted O
in O
his O
death O
in O
November O
1988. O
After O
a O
trial O
, O
the O
jury O
rendered O
a O
verdict O
for O

. O
On O

, O

BACKGROUND O
Richard O
Hoem O
underwent O
a O
physical O
examination O
in O
March O
1988. O
An O
electrocardiogram O
test O
(EKG) O
done O
as O
a O
part O
of O
this O
examination O
revealed O
no O
signs O
of O
heart O
problems O
. O
During O
the O
summer O
of O
that O
year O
, O
Hoem O
began O
to O
develop O
problems O
with O
his O
endurance. O
Thinking O
that O
his O
problems O
might O
be O
related O
to O
a O
previous O
lung O
condition O
, O
Hoem O
consulted O
Dr. O
Zia O
, O
a O
specialist O
in O
pulmonology. O
Dr. O
Zia O
had O
last O
treated O
Hoem O
in O
1984 O
when O
Hoem O
failed O
a O
work-related O
lung O
test O
. O
On O
October O
31 O
, O
1988 O
, O
Dr. O
Zia O
administered O
a O
series O
of O
tests O
designed O
to O
detect O
lung O
problems. O
He O
also O
scheduled O
Hoem O
to O
undergo O
a O
cardiopulmonary O
stress O
test O
on O
November O
11 O
, O
1988 O
, O
to O
measure O
lung O
capacity O
and O
fitness O
. O
Because O
Dr. O
Zia O
was O
on O
vacation O
on O
November O
11 O
, O
1988 O
, O
his O
partner O
, O
Dr. O
Arnold O
, O
administered O
the O
test. O
During O
the O
test O
, O
Hoem O
exercised O
on O
a O
stationary O
cycle O
while O
an O
EKG O
monitored O
his O
heart O
rate O
as O
he O
breathed O
into O
a O
tube O
that O
monitored O
his O
lung O
capacity O
, O
strength O
, O
and O
endurance. O
The O
test O
also O
monitored O
blood O
pressure O
. O
On O
November O
21 O
, O
Dr. O
Arnold O
notified O
Hoem O
that O
he O
had O
found O
a O
"blockage\u201d O
, O
on O
the O
test O
and O
had O
scheduled O
Hoem O
to O
meet O
with O
a O
cardiologist O
, O
Dr. O
Krishan O
Patel O
, O
a O
week O
later O
, O
on O
November O
29 O
, O
1988. O
The O
day O
prior O
to O
that O
meeting O
, O
however O
, O
Hoem O
collapsed O
after O
walking O
up O
a O
flight O
of O
stairs O
and O
later O
died O
. O
Plaintiff O
then O
brought O
suit O
against O
defendants O
, O
Dr. O
Michael O
Zia O
, O
Dr. O
J. O
Steven O
Arnold O
, O
Decatur O
Memorial O
Hospital O
, O
and O
Central O
Illinois O
Lung O
Internists O
Associates. O
Plaintiff\u2019s O
principal O
allegation O
of O
negligence O
was O
that O
Drs. O
Zia O
and O
Arnold O
had O
failed O
to O
recognize O
, O
and O
treat O
on O
an O
emergency O
basis O
, O
Hoem\u2019s O
cardiac O
condition O
. O
During O
plaintiff\u2019s O
case O
in O
chief O
, O
she O
presented O
the O
expert O
testimony O
of O
Dr. O
Dan O
Fintel O
, O
a O
cardiologist. O
Dr. O
Fintel O
testified O
that O
the O
EKG O
and O
medical O
charts O
showed O
*197clear O
signs O
of O
a O
prior O
heart O
attack O
and O
clear O
warnings O
of O
an O
impending O
heart O
attack. O
Dr. O
Fintel O
testified O
that O
when O
Hoem O
visited O
Dr. O
Zia O
on O
October O
31 O
, O
1988 O
, O
Hoem O
was O
describing O
angina O
to O
Dr. O
Zia O
, O
which O
is O
an O
undisputed O
symptom O
of O
heart O
disease. O
He O
testified O
that O
based O
upon O
the O
information O
that O
Dr. O
Zia O
recorded O
in O
his O
office O
notes O
, O
Dr. O
Zia O
should O
have O
recognized O
Hoem\u2019s O
complaints O
as O
angina O
, O
and O
hence O
initiated O
a O
program O
of O
cardiac O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
. O
Defendants O
responded O
by O
calling O
themselves O
and O
three O
other O
doctors O
as O
medical O
experts: O
Dr. O
Patel O
(the O
cardiologist O
whom O
Hoem O
was O
scheduled O
to O
see) O
, O
Dr. O
William O
Buckingham O
(a O
board-certified O
internist O
and O
pulmonologist) O
, O
and O
Dr. O
Patrick O
Sullivan O
(a O
board-certified O
internist) O
. O
Over O
plaintiff\u2019s O
Dead-Man\u2019s O
Act O
objection O
, O
Dr. O
Zia O
testified O
concerning O
his O
examination O
of O
Hoem O
on O
October O
31 O
, O
1988. O
Dr. O
Zia O
stated O
that O
the O
pain O
which O
Hoem O
described O
to O
him O
was O
not O
consistent O
with O
angina O
, O
but O
rather O
was O
consistent O
with O
musculoskeletal O
pain. O
Therefore O
, O
Dr. O
Zia O
did O
not O
suspect O
Hoem O
was O
suffering O
from O
heart O
disease O
, O
and O
did O
not O
initiate O
treatment O
for O
it O
. O
Among O
other O
things O
, O
Dr. O
Patel O
testified O
that O
the O
medical O
results O
from O
Hoem\u2019s O
test O
did O
not O
present O
an O
urgent O
medical O
condition. O
He O
added O
that O
, O
if O
he O
had O
read O
the O
charts O
and O
results O
from O
Hoem\u2019s O
test O
immediately O
after O
Hoem O
took O
the O
test O
, O
he O
would O
not O
have O
done O
anything O
differently O
than O
Dr. O
Arnold O
had O
done O
. O
Dr. O
Buckingham O
and O
both O
defendants O
testified O
that O
although O
Dr. O
Fintel O
may O
know O
the O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
a O
cardiologist O
, O
he O
did O
not O
testify O
to O
the O
applicable O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
pulmonologists. O
All O
three O
testified O
that O
although O
cardiologists O
might O
notice O
subtle O
, O
but O
life-threatening O
, O
heart O
problems O
from O
Hoem\u2019s O
medical O
data O
, O
pulmonologists O
would O
not O
notice O
these O
subtle O
problems. O
Dr. O
Sullivan O
and O
both O
defendants O
testified O
essentially O
to O
the O
same O
standard O
of O
care O
regarding O
internists O
. O
*198In O
rebuttal O
, O
plaintiff O
attempted O
to O
present O
Dr. O
Robert O
Schoene O
, O
a O
board-certified O
pulmonologist O
, O
to O
testify O
that O
Dr. O
Fintel O
had O
accurately O
stated O
the O
applicable O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
pulmonologists. O
The O
trial O
court O
, O
however O
, O
restricted O
the O
extent O
to O
which O
plaintiff O
could O
do O
so O
under O
the O
general O
theory O
that O
plaintiff O
could O
have O
presented O
Dr. O
Schoene O
in O
her O
case O
in O
chief O
, O
but O
failed O
to O
do O
so O
. O
On O
appeal O
, O
plaintiff O
argued O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
(1) O
erred O
by O
admitting O
testimony O
barred O
by O
the O

in O

, O
Dr. O

, O
plaintiffs O

in O

testified O
that O

Dr. O

testified O

I O
think O

was O

[Defense O

What O
did O
he O
say? O
[Dr. O

As O
Mrs. O

tell O
you O
by O
way O

history O

Doctor? O
[Dr. O
Zia]: O
His O
symptoms O
he O
mentioned O
began O
about O
August O

there O
was O
a O

that O

That O

as O
many O
people O
have O
described. O
He O
did O
notice O
it O

He O
said O
that O
this O
symptom O
had O
already O
been O
evaluated O
, O
had O
initially O

the O

took O

that O
were O

for O
the O

[Dr. O

Yes O

I O
have O

[Plaintiff\u2019s O

Doctor O
, O
what O
is O
it O
in O
those O
records O
that O
leads O
you O
to O
express O
the O
opinion O
that O
Mr. O
Hoem O
had O
exertional O
chest O
pain? O
[Dr. O
Fintel]: O
I O
base O
this O
on O
reading O
what O
is O
a O
very O
well-documented O
and O
legible O
typed O
note O
, O
that O
which O
we O
all O
see O
on O
our O
right. O
Looking O
at O
the O
second O
line O
where O
I O
read O
, O
'he O
, O
\u2019 O
referred O
to O
Mr. O

, O
'is O
complaining O

area. O
This O
occurs O
primarily O
with O
exertion O
and O
does O
seem O
to O
radiate O
down O

That O
to O
me O
suggests O
that O
Dr. O
Zia O
recognized O
that O
the O
principal O
reason O
why O
the O
patient O
came O
to O
the O
office O
for O
evaluation O
was O
for O
evaluation O
and O
treatment O
of O
this O
problem.\u201d O
From O
these O
statements O
, O
it O
may O
be O
argued O
that O
Dr. O
Fintel O
is O
merely O
interpreting O
the O
note. O
He O
is O
, O
however O
, O
doing O
more O
than O
that. O
Rather O
than O
merely O
translating O
Dr. O
Zia\u2019s O
note O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
jury O
, O
Dr. O
Fintel O
has O
put O
his O
gloss O
on O
the O
notes. O
Taking O
Dr. O
Fintel\u2019s O
statements O
together O
, O
he O
is O
clearly O
insinuating O
that O
Hoem O
visited O
Dr. O
Zia O
specifically O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
a O
heart O
related O
problem. O
Under O
these O
facts O
, O
we O
find O
that O
Dr. O
Fintel\u2019s O
testimony O
falls O
within O
subsection O
(a) O
of O
the O
Act O

that O

The O

to O
remove O
the O

of O

equalize O

Under O

we O
find O
it O
fundamentally O

to O
explain O
his O
view O
of O
what O

and O

B. O
The O
Scope O
of O
Dr. O
Schoene\u2019s O
Testimony O
Defendants O
next O
contend O
that O
the O
appellate O
court O
improperly O
held O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
had O
erroneously O
restricted O
the O
rebuttal O
testimony O
of O
Dr. O
Schoene. O
We O
disagree O
and O
affirm O
the O
appellate O
court O
decision O
. O
Originally O
, O
plaintiff O
only O
named O
Dr. O
Fintel O
as O
her O
expert. O
In O
August O
1991 O
, O
defendants O
filed O
a O
motion O
for O
summary O
judgment O
based O
on O
their O
claim O
that O
because O
plaintiffs O
only O
named O
expert O
, O
Dr. O
Fintel O
, O
was O
a O
cardiologist O
, O
he O
could O
establish O
neither O
the O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
a O
pulmonologist O
nor O
any O
deviation O
therefrom. O
Thus O
, O
in O
her O
September O
1991 O
response O
to O
defendants\u2019 O
summary O
judgment O
motion O
, O
filed O
two O
months O
before O
the O
November O
1991 O
trial O
, O
plaintiff O
asked O
the O
trial O
court O
to O
add O
Dr. O
Schoene O
to O
the O
list O
she O
previously O
disclosed O
under O
Illinois O
Supreme O
Court O
Rule O
220 O
(134 O
Ill. O
2d O
R. O

of O
expert O
witnesses O
she O
intended O
to O
call O
in O
her O
case O
in O
chief O
. O
The O
trial O
court O
denied O
defendants\u2019 O
motion O
for O
summary O
judgment O
and O
held O
that O
Dr. O
Fintel\u2019s O
testimony O
could O
suffice O
to O
establish O
the O
appropriate O
standard O
of O
care O
and O
any O
deviation O
therefrom O
because O
Dr. O
Fintel O
and O
defendants O
were O
all O
board-certified O
internists O
, O
and O
because O
of O
the O
close O
relation O
betw\u00e9en O
the O
fields O
of O
pulmonology O
and O
cardiology O
and O
Dr. O
Fintel\u2019s O
experience O
in O
both. O
The O
court O
, O
however O
, O
refused O
to O
the O
permit O
Dr. O
*203Schoene O
to O
testify O
in O
plaintiff\u2019s O
case O
in O
chief O
because O
plaintiff O
did O
not O
originally O
disclose O
him O
as O
an O
expert O
in O
her O
case O
in O
chief. O
The O
court O
explained O
that O
the O
ensuing O
delays O
from O
allowing O
plaintiff O
to O
add O
Dr. O
Schoene O
as O
an O
expert O
in O
her O
case O
in O
chief O
would O
be O
unnecessarily O
burdensome O
. O
At O
trial O
, O
plaintiff O
relied O
on O
Dr. O
Fintel O
to O
establish O
the O
standard O
of O
care O
in O
her O
case O
in O
chief. O
After O
plaintiff O
rested O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
denied O
defendants\u2019 O
motion O
for O
a O
directed O
verdict O
, O
thus O
indicating O
that O
it O
found O
Dr. O
Fin-tel\u2019s O
testimony O
legally O
sufficient. O
Defendants O
then O
countered O
in O
their O
case O
in O
chief O
with O
testimony O
to O
the O
effect O
that O
although O
Dr. O
Fintel O
probably O
correctly O
stated O
the O
applicable O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
cardiologists O
, O
he O
did O
not O
correctly O
state O
the O
applicable O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
pulmonologists. O
They O
further O
testified O
that O
the O
medical O
records O
and O
information O
that O
Dr. O
Zia O
received O
would O
not O
have O
signaled O
Hoem\u2019s O
impending O
heart O
condition O
to O
a O
pulmonologist O
, O
especially O
because O
pulmonologists O
are O
trained O
to O
notice O
mostly O
lung O
conditions O
. O
Plaintiff O
then O
offered O
Dr. O
Schoene O
in O
rebuttal O
to O
testify O
that O
Dr. O
Fintel O
did O
correctly O
state O
the O
applicable O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
pulmonologists O
, O
and O
that O
a O
pulmonologist O
such O
as O
himself O
would O
have O
noticed O
Hoem\u2019s O
impending O
heart O
condition O
and O
sent O
Hoem O
immediately O
to O
obtain O
treatment O
for O
it. O
Defendants O
object O
to O
Dr. O
Schoene\u2019s O
testifying O
in O
rebuttal O
, O
and O
the O
trial O
court O
sustained O
that O
objection. O
The O
trial O
court O
held O
that O
Dr. O
Schoene O
could O
not O
testify O
to O
the O
general O
standard O
of O
care O
for O
pulmonologists O
because O
plaintiff O
should O
have O
presented O
that O
evidence O
in O
her O
case O
in O

That O

*204On O
appeal O
to O

defendants O
argue O
that O
the O
trial O
court O
properly O
restricted O
the O
scope O
of O
Dr. O
Schoene\u2019s O
testimony. O
They O
maintain O
that O
plaintiff O
committed O
a O
fundamental O
tactical O
error O
in O
the O
preparation O
of O
her O
case O
for O
trial O
by O
retaining O
an O
inappropriate O
expert O
and O
should O
not O
be O
allowed O
to O
rectify O
this O
mistake O
through O
rebuttal O
. O
We O
cannot O
agree O
with O
this O
tactical-error O
analysis. O
To O
adopt O
the O
defendants\u2019 O
view O
on O
this O
issue O
would O
be O
tantamount O
to O
requiring O
a O
plaintiff O
to O
anticipate O
and O
present O
all O
conceivably O
relevant O
evidence O
in O
her O
case O
in O
chief O
, O
because O
, O
otherwise O
, O
she O
would O
be O
barred O
from O
presenting O
that O
evidence O
in O
rebuttal O
in O
the O
event O
defendants O
presented O
evidence O
in O
their O
case O
in O
chief O
that O
plaintiff O
needed O
to O
counter. O
As O
stated O
by O
the O
appellate O
court O
in O
this O
case O
, O
such O
a O
rule O
would O
be O
"antithetical O
to O
the O
concerns O
expressed O
by O
all O
involved O
in O
our O
civil O
justice O

about O
its O

Defendants O
further O
argue O
that O
Dr. O
Schoene\u2019s O
testimony O
would O
not O
be O
proper O
rebuttal O
evidence. O
They O
argue O
that O
there O
is O
scant O
evidence O
from O
the O
record O
which O
would O
indicate O
that O
defendants O
had O
impeached O
Dr. O
Fintel O
on O
the O
standard O
of O
care O
issue O
. O
Contrary O
to O
defendants\u2019 O
contention O
, O
there O
is O
evidence O
in O
the O
record O
indicating O
that O
defendants O
had O
impeached O
Dr. O
Fintel. O
Specifically O
, O
defendants\u2019 O
expert O
, O
Dr. O
Buckingham O
, O
testified O
that O
from O
his O
perspective O
as O
a O
pulmonologist O
, O
the O
stress O
test O
results O
did O
not O
require O
an O
immediate O
referral O
to O
a O
cardiologist. O
When O
asked O
whether O
he O
had O
any O
disagreement O
in O
whole O
or O
in O
part O
with O
Dr. O
Fintel\u2019s O
statements O
on O
that O
aspect O
of O
the O
case O
, O
Dr. O
Buckingham O
responded: O
"My O
disagreement O
was O
in O
whole. O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
same O
cardiogram O
, O
Dr. O
Fintel O
is O
a O
cardiologist O
, O
and O
I\u2019m O
a O
pulmonologist. O
I O
looked O
at O
the O
cardiogram-tracings O
and O
did O
not O
*205see O
anything O
I O
as O
a O
pulmonologist O
would O
identify O
as O
abnormalities.\u201d O
Dr. O
Buckingham O
further O
stated: O
"As O
I O
say O
, O
you O
can O
have O
as O
many O
interpretations O
as O
you O
have O
interpreters O
, O
and O
they O
may O
not O
always O
agree O
, O
but O
certainly O
a O
cardiologist O
might O
look O
at O
an O
electrocardiographic O
tracing O
differently O
than O
a O
pulmonologist O
would O
, O
but O
I O
don\u2019t O
think O
the O
pulmonologist O
could O
be O
held O
to O
the O
standard O
of O
the O
cardiologist O
because O
he\u2019s O
a O
pulmonologist.\u201d O
This O
testimony O
could O
have O
left O
the O
jury O
with O
the O
impression O
that O
plaintiff\u2019s O
expert O
had O
expressed O
an O
inappropriate O
standard O
of O
care O
with O
regard O
to O
reading O
the O
test O
results. O
Given O
these O
circumstances O
, O
we O
find O
that O
plaintiff O
was O
entitled O
to O
have O
Dr. O
Schoene O
testify O
on O
rebuttal O
. O

CROSS-APPEAL O
Aside O
from O
the O
two O
issues O

by O

plaintiff O
raises O
several O
issues O
on O
cross-appeal O
with O
regard O
to O
certain O
adverse O
rulings O
by O
the O
appellate O
court. O
We O
find O
, O

that O
these O

have O
been O
fully O
covered O
by O
the O
well-considered O

JUSTICE B-A
LUND I-A
delivered O
the O
opinion O
of O
the O
court: O
Respondent O
James O
Self O
appeals O
from O
an O
order O
of O
the O
circuit O
court O
of O
Cass O
County O
denying O
relief O
from O
a O
dissolution O
order O
requiring O
him O
to O
maintain O
health O
insurance O
coverage O
for O
his O
daughter O
from O
his O
first O
marriage. O
The O
trial O
court O
appears O
to O
have O
concluded O
that O
it O
did O
not O
have O
the O
power O
to O
change O
a O
prior O
agreement O
of O
the O
parties. O
We O
affirm O
for O
another O
reason O
. O
Respondent O
was O
substantially O
behind O
with O
his O
child O
support O
payments O
, O
and O
he O
was O
not O
maintaining O
health O
insurance O
coverage. O
He O
had O
remarried O
, O
had O
two O
additional O
children O
, O
and O
had O
filed O
for O
bankruptcy. O
At O
the O
time O
of O
the O
trial O
court O
hearing O
, O
he O
was O
employed O
, O
earning O
a O
net O
weekly O
take-home O
income O
of O
$362.86. O
Health O
insurance O
, O
which O
would O
have O
covered O
him O
, O
his O
spouse O
, O
and O
both O
his O
children O
, O
was O
available O
through O
his O
employer O
at O
a O
cost O
of O
$200 O
per O
month. O
His O
child O
support O
order O
required O
him O
to O
pay O
$50 O
per O
week O
, O
plus O
$2.30 O
on O
the O
arrearage. O
Respondent O
contends O
the O
trial O
court O
erred O
in O
ruling O
*805that O
it O
had O
no O
discretion O
to O
modify O
the O
order O
on O
health O
insurance. O
He O
also O
argues O
that O
he O
presented O
sufficient O
evidence O
to O
establish O
that O
he O
could O
not O
afford O
to O
maintain O
the O
health O
insurance. O
The O
Illinois O
Department O
of O
Public O
Aid O
(Department) O
intervened O
in O
this O
case O
, O
because O
of O
the O
State\u2019s O
contribution O
for O
both O
the O
support O
and O
medical O
expenses O
. O

These O
comments O
make O
clear O
that O
the O
EPA\u2019s O
primary O
concern O
was O
leaking O
underground O
storage O
tanks. O
The O
Federal O
agency O
noted O
that O
many O

have O
begun O
to O
leak O
, O
but O
that O
the O
leaks O
often O
go O
undetected O

someone O
sees O
or O
smells O
the O
release. O

agency O
found O
that O
only O
about O

incidents O
were O
discovered O
through O

Fed. O
Reg. O

. O
Harlem O
points O
out O
that O
the O
EPA O
also O
considered O
releases O
caused O
by O
spills O
and O
overfills O
during O
the O
course O
of O
filling O
the O
tanks O
from O
a O
hose O
connected O
to O
a O
truck. O
Harlem O
contends O
that O
that O
situation O
is O
analogous O
to O
the O
instant O
case O
, O
where O
the O
spill O
occurred O
by O
pouring O
fuel O
out O
of O
the O
tank O
through O
a O
hose O
. O
We O
believe O
the O
Board\u2019s O
interpretation O
is O
a O
reasonable O
one O
, O
consistent O
with O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
statute. O
The O
UST O
program O
was O
designed O
to O
alleviate O
environmental O
damage O
caused O
by O
leaking O
underground O
storage O
tanks. O
By O
nature O
, O
such O
leaks O
are O
difficult O
to O
spot O
and O
often O
difficult O
to O
prevent. O
Once O
a O
tank O
is O
placed O
in O
the O
ground O
, O
the O
owner O
has O
little O
practical O
control O
over O
it. O
By O
contrast O
, O
pumps O
and O
nozzles O
are O
located O
above O
ground O
and O
are O
subject O
to O
the O
owner\u2019s O
control. O
It O
is O
*45reasonable O
to O
place O
the O
burden O
of O
cleaning O
up O
such O
spills O
on O
the O
owner O
or O
operator O
, O
who O
is O
able O
to O
take O
preventive O
measures. O
In O
this O
case O
, O
for O
example O
, O
better O
security O
at O
Harlem\u2019s O
garage O
might O
have O
prevented O
the O
incident O
. O
\u20222 O
Contrary O
to O
Harlem\u2019s O
contention O
, O
the O
purpose O
of O
the O
UST O
program O
will O
not O
be O
frustrated O
by O
excluding O
coverage O
for O
spills O
from O
above-ground O
pump O
handles. O
Such O
spills O
, O
while O
numerous O
, O
are O
usually O
small O
and O
, O
as O
noted O
, O
can O
be O
readily O
detected O
and O
cleaned O
up O
quickly. O
Moreover O
, O
as O
the O
Board O
notes O
, O
expanding O
coverage O
as O
Harlem O
suggests O
might O
actually O
frustrate O
the O
program\u2019s O
purpose. O
Including O
spills O
from O
above-ground O
pumps O
and O
nozzles O
would O
subject O
the O
fund O
to O
a O
potentially O
limitless O
new O
class O
of O
claims. O
The O
fund O
, O
of O
course O
, O
has O
limited O
resources O
, O
and O
the O
statute O
provides O
that O
claims O
may O
not O
be O
paid O
if O
there O
are O
insufficient O
funds O
in O
the O
account. O

Requiring O

the O

We O
are O
also O
unconvinced O
that O
references O
to O
spills O
resulting O
from O
the O
filling O
of O
the O
tank O
require O
a O
different O
result. O
In O
the O
preamble O
to O
its O
proposed O
regulations O
, O
the O
EPA O
briefly O
mentioned O
such O
"spills O
and O
overfills O
, O
\u201d O
noting O
that O
such O
incidents O
are O
the O
most O
common O
type O
of O
release. O
However O
, O
the O
EPA O
also O
noted O
the O
small O
volume O
of O
fuel O
typically O
released O
in O
this O
type O
of O
spill. O
53 O
Fed. O
Reg. O

(1988) O
. O
Harlem O
suggests O
that O
spills O
and O
overfills O
are O
analogous O
to O
the O
present O
situation O
, O
where O
the O
fuel O
was O
spilled O
in O
the O
course O
of O
being O
emptied O
from O
the O
tank. O
We O
cannot O
agree. O
As O
the O
Board O
notes O
, O
a O
spill O
from O
a O
gas O
pump O
is O
simply O
not O
a O
spill O
from O
an O
underground O
storage O
tank. O
The O
regulatory O
definition O
of O
a O
UST O
system O
does O
not O
include O
above-ground O
dispensing O
devices O
such O
as O
pumps O
and O
nozzles. O
(35 O
Ill. O
Adm. O
Code O
\u00a7 O
731.112 O
(1991).) O
Moreover O
, O
the O
EPA O
apparently O
included O
spills O
and O
overfills O
in O
the O
Federal O
program O
because O
of O
concern O
about O
the O
corrosive O
effect O
of O
the O
spilled O
fuel O
on O
the O
tanks O
themselves. O
(See O
53 O
Fed. O
Reg. O
37090 O
(1988).) O
Harlem O
has O
not O
demonstrated O
that O
similar O
concerns O
are O
present O
where O
, O
as O
here O
, O
the O
fuel O
is O
released O
from O
a O
pump O
nozzle O
remote O
from O
the O
tank O
itself. O
Finally O
, O
it O
is O
significant O
that O
the O
EPA O
, O
while O
discussing O
spills O
and O
overfills O
in O
the O
course O
of O
filling O
the O
tank O
, O
did O
not O
mention O
at O
all O
the O
supposedly O
analogous O
situation O
of O
spills O
of O
fuel O
coming O
out O
of O
the O
tank. O
These O
considerations O
lead O
us O
to O
conclude O
that O
spills O
from O
a O
pump O
nozzle O
were O
not O
intended O
to O
be O
included O
in O
the O
statutory O
scheme O
. O
Finally O
, O
Harlem O
contends O
that O
the O
Board\u2019s O
decision O
is O
inconsistent O
with O
its O
decision O
in O

The O

in O

whether O

applied O
to O

Specifically O
, O
the O

was O
whether O

knowledge O
of O
the O

prior O
to O

The O

were O
for O

Act O
(Act) O
(820 O

(West O

. O
Plaintiff O
was O
seriously O
injured O
in O
the O
course O
of O
his O
employment O
, O
when O
the O
truck O
he O
was O
driving O
was O
struck O
by O
a O
school O
bus. O
In O
an O
offer O
of O
proof O
during O
trial O
of O
the O
common-law O
action O
, O
PRM O
employee O
Nancy O
Peck O
, O
a O
registered O
nurse O
, O
testified O
she O
was O
hired O
as O
a O
third-party O
objective O
consultant O
to O
assure O
that O
appropriate O
medical O
care O
was O
given. O
When O
asked O
whose O
interests O
she O
was O
obligated O
to O
protect O
, O
the O
insurance O
company O
or O
the O
patient O
, O
she O
replied: O
"The O
patient O
, O
to O
see O
that O
that O
person O
gets O
the O
best O
medical O
care O
, O
ends O
up O
being O
as O
good O
a O
person O
medically O
as O
he O
or O
she O
can O
be.\u201d O
However O
, O
when O
asked O
whether O
she O
considered O
her O
work O
medical O
treatment O
or O
management O
of O
the O
workers\u2019 O
compensation O
case O
, O
she O
replied O
"management.\u201d O
Peck O
was O
then O
asked O
to O
give O
a O
general O
overview O
of O
the O
services O
she O
provided O
plaintiff. O
She O
replied: O
"I O
started O
with O
David O
Cole O
in O
October O
of O
\u201988. O
Initially O
I O
interviewed O
him O
, O
which O
gives O
me O
a O
whole O
picture O
of O
his O
case O
and O
this O
follows O
with O
the O
objectivity. O
How O
did O
he O
feel O
about O
his O
medical O
care O
, O
was O
he O
happy O
with O
his O
physicians O
, O
how O
was O
he O
doing O
, O
visually O
could O
see O
how O
was O
he O
doing O
. O
From O
there O
initially O
I O
went O
through O
the O
medical O
records O
also O
, O
and O
from O
there O
I O
recommended O
to O
the O
insurance O
company O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
think O
he O
is O
receiving O
appropriate O
medical O
care O
, O
he O
is O
seeing O
an O
orthopedic O
specialist. O
After O
the O
initial O
interview O
I O
kept O
in O
contact O
with O
him O
again O
to O
see O
how O
he O
was O
doing. O
I O
would O
go O
to O
the O
office O
visits O
with O
him. O
Periodically O
I O
would O
go O
to O
physical O
therapy O
to O
see O
how O
he O
was O
doing O
there O
, O
again O
, O
all O
this O
time O
to O
see O
whether O
he O
is O
making O
any O
improvement O
, O
what O
is O
going O
on O
, O
where O
could O
I O
recommend O
maybe O
some O
more O
efficient O
management O
. O
I O
can O
think O
of O
one O
particular O
instance O
where O
in O
the O
wintertime O
he O
was O
having O
trouble O
getting O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
Champaign O
for O
physical O
therapy O
, O
and O
I O
did O
some O
research O
in O
the O
immediate O
area O
to O
see O
if O
some O
amount O
of O
physical O
therapy O
could O
be O
obtained O
in O
his O
area. O
It O
wasn\u2019t O
possible. O
But O
that O
was O
one O
case O
because O
if O
he O
could O
have O
gotten O
it O
there O
it O
would O
have O
saved O
him O
trips O
back O
and O
forth O
to O
Champaign O
. O
When O
he O
had O
his O
surgeries O
I O
would O
make O
contact O
with O
him O
, O
sometimes O
in O
the O
hospital O
, O
to O
follow O
up O
with O
his O
home O
health. O
This O
was O
a O
big O
thing O
and O
probably O
the O
first O
six O
months O
, O
maybe O
nine O
*800months O
, O
and O
this O
certainly O
wasn\u2019t O
cost O
effective. O
But O
this O
was O
a O
better O
management O
tool O
, O
to O
visit O
with O
him O
to O
see O
if O
he O
needed O
home O
help O
nursing O
, O
to O
see O
if O
there O
was O
anything O
in O
the O
home O
that O
he O
needed O
in O
the O
way O
of O
equipment. O
Several O
times O
I O
assessed O
the O
home O
as O
far O
as O
the O
bathroom O
, O
were O
there O
any O
modifications O
that O
could O
have O
been O
done O
to O
make O
the O
bathroom O
more O
easily O
accessible O
for O
him. O
He O
was O
there O
by O
himself O
during O
the O
daytime O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
the O
time O
because O
his O
wife O
worked O
, O
and O
so O
I O
made O
some O
assessments O
of O
the O
kitchen O
, O
[were] O
there O
areas O
there O
that O
could O
be O
modified O
for O
him O
to O
make O
those O
facilities O
more O
accessible O
. O
I O
offered O
all O
along O
the O
way O
quite O
a O
bit O
of O
moral O
support O
to O
him. O
Also O
maybe O
some O
support O
in O
the O
way O
of O
answering O
questions. O
He O
always O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
questions O
about O
what O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
to O
him O
as O
far O
as O
the O
next O
surgery O
goes O
, O
what O
would O
happen O
to O
him O
in O
another O
month O
or O
two.\u201d O
Peck O
admitted O
that O
she O
was O
responsible O
for O
reporting O
plaintiff\u2019s O
progress O
to O
Farmland. O
A O
small O
portion O
of O
the O
charges O
for O
her O
services O
was O
for O
time O
spent O
consulting O
with O
the O
attorneys O
involved O
in O
the O
litigation O
and O
preparing O
reports O
for O
Farmland. O
Analyzing O
cost O
effectiveness O
only O
came O
into O
play O
when O
ordering O
equipment O
or O
long-term O
supplies. O
She O
never O
saw O
any O
of O
the O
bills O
for O
her O
services O
, O
and O
cost O
effectiveness O
of O
medical O
care O
was O
not O
her O
concern. O
She O
admitted O
that O
she O
followed O
orders O
from O
Farmland; O
if O
they O
told O
her O
to O
work O
more O
with O
the O
patient O
, O
she O
would O
work O
more. O
If O
they O
told O
her O
to O
stop O
, O
she O
would O
stop O
. O
At O
the O
conclusion O
of O
Peck\u2019s O
testimony O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
held O
that O
her O
services O
did O
not O
constitute O
treatment O
, O
but O
merely O
management O
of O
the O
workers\u2019 O
compensation O
case. O
Accordingly O
, O
Peck\u2019s O
testimony O
was O
not O
given O
to O
the O
jury O
, O
and O
PRM\u2019s O
fee O
was O
not O
admitted O
into O
evidence O
as O
proof O
of O
plaintiff\u2019s O
medical O
expenses O
. O
Following O
trial O
, O
a O
hearing O
was O
held O
to O
determine O
the O
amount O
of O
the O
intervenors\u2019 O
lien. O
In O
support O
of O
their O
position O
, O
the O
intervenors O
presented O
excerpts O
of O
Peck\u2019s O
trial O
testimony O
made O
during O
the O
offer O
of O
proof. O
In O
addition O
, O
Nydra O
Owen O
, O
the O
master O
claims O
adjustor O
for O
Farmland O
, O
testified O
regarding O
Peck\u2019s O
duties O
and O
the O
handling O
of O
plaintiff\u2019s O
workers\u2019 O
compensation O
case. O
Owen O
was O
responsible O
for O
retaining O
PRM O
and O
assigning O
them O
to O
plaintiff\u2019s O
case. O
She O
testified O
that O
PRM O
was O
placed O
on O
his O
case O
just O
prior O
to O
his O
coming O
home O
from O
the O
hospital. O
Her O
purpose O
was O
to O
make O
certain O
he O
received O
what O
he O
needed O
when O
he O
was O
at O
home. O
When O
asked O
why O
she O
retained O
Peck\u2019s O
services O
in O
this O
case O
, O
she O
replied: O
"Okay. O
In O
this O
particular O
case O
, O
after O
I O
had O
met O
with O
them O
, O
they O
had O
a O
close O
family O
and O
I O
was O
real O
concerned O
, O
because O
traditionally O
or O
statistically O
when O
you O
have O
a O
catastrophic O
injury O
, O
as O
we O
had O
in O
*801this O
case O
, O
many O
times O
, O
you O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
family O
problems O
and O
I O
wanted O
to O
unload O
, O
as O
much O
as O
I O
could O
, O
on O
that O
family O
situation. O
So O
that O
there O
wouldn\u2019t O
be O
any O
family O
problems. O
So O
, O
I O
wanted O
to O
make O
sure O
he O
got O
the O
best O
that O
he O
could O
get O
in O
home O
care O
and O
that O
type O
of O
thing O
. O
BY O
MS. O
WALL: O
Q[J O
And O
, O
did O
Nancy O
Peck O
then O
provide O
that O
service O
to O
Farmland O
through O
PKM? O
A[.] O
Yes O
, O
she O
went O
out O
there O
to O
make O
sure. O
She O
went O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
he O
would O
have O
whatever O
he O
needed O
when O
he O
went O
home.\u201d O
Owen O
also O
discussed O
Peck\u2019s O
role O
with O
regard O
to O
cost O
containment O
of O
plaintiff\u2019s O
medical O
case. O
Owen O
stated O
that O
Peck O
was O
responsible O
for O
contacting O
Farmland O
when O
expenses O
were O
incurred O
through O
any O
treatment O
that O
Peck O
had O
recommended. O
However O
, O
she O
would O
only O
contact O
Farmland O
when O
these O
costs O
exceeded O
her O
own O
recommendation. O
Owen O
denied O
that O
she O
ordered O
Peck O
to O
pursue O
the O
most O
cost-effective O
treatment O
, O
claiming O
there O
were O
times O
when O
Peck\u2019s O
recommendations O
actually O
increased O
the O
cost O
of O
plaintiff\u2019s O
treatment. O
She O
stated O
that O
Peck O
was O
not O
hired O
to O
do O
any O
auditing O
of O
the O
medical O
services O
provided. O
She O
added O
that O
auditing O
services O
were O
offered O
through O
a O
completely O
separate O
department O
at O
PKM. O
She O
also O
denied O
that O
Peck O
performed O
any O
tasks O
in O
the O
nature O
of O
claims O
handling O
that O
aided O
her O
in O
handling O
plaintiff\u2019s O
file. O
Owen O
summarized O
her O
own O
role O
in O
handling O
plaintiff\u2019s O
case: O
"[W]hen O
you O
have O
several O
doctors O
, O
it\u2019s O
difficult O
to O
have O
one O
person O
to O
be O
able O
to O
work O
, O
because O
many O
times O
, O
those O
doctors O
are O
so O
busy O
, O
that O
you O
can O
get O
additional O
explanation O
on O
what O
they O
said. O
I O
think O
all O
of O
us O
have O
been O
to O
a O
doctor O
where O
they O
have O
been O
so O
rushed O
. O
Q[. O
Plaintiff\u2019s O
counsel:] O
Then O
, O
your O
primary O
interest O
in O
this O
, O
your O
loyalty O
and O
interest O
was O
to O
your O
employer O
, O
wasn\u2019t O
it? O
A[.] O
In O
this O
particular O
case O
, O
let O
me O
give O
you O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
preface. O
I O
was O
an O
administrator O
for O
several O
years. O
This O
was O
the O
first O
catastrophic O
injury O
that O
I O
actually O
went O
out O
in O
the O
field O
on O
and O
, O
even O
though O
, O
I O
handled O
for O
several O
years O
injuries O
in O
the O
office O
, O
at O
this O
level O
, O
when O
you O
see O
the O
school O
bus O
and O
you O
see O
the O
vehicle O
and O
you O
see O
the O
people O
and O
you O
will O
see O
them O
, O
it O
touches O
you O
more O
than O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
office. O
My O
concern O
when O
I O
went O
out O
to O
see O
David O
and O
saw O
David O
[with] O
his O
family O
and O
I O
can O
truly O
say O
that O
in O
this O
particular O
case O
, O
I O
was O
most O
concerned O
yes. O
I O
worked O
for O
Farmland O
a O
long O
time. O
In O
this O
particular O
case O
, O
I O
was O
not O
out O
to O
save O
Farmland O
money.\u201d O
*802After O
hearing O
arguments O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
concluded O
that O
, O
although O
Owen O
cared O
about O
plaintiffs O
condition O
, O
she O
did O
not O
know O
specifically O
what O
services O
Peck O
provided. O
The O
best O
person O
to O
know O
what O
Peck O
was O
doing O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
stated O
, O
was O
Farmland O
(which O
received O
her O
reports). O
After O
reviewing O
Peck\u2019s O
testimony O
, O
the O
trial O
court O
decided O
she O
was O
an O
agent O
of O
Farmland O
and O
denied O
the O
intervenors\u2019 O
request O
to O
include O
PRM\u2019s O
fee O
in O
their O
lien O
. O
el O
In O
cases O
like O
this O
, O
if O
damages O
are O
recovered O
in O
a O
common-law O
action O
, O
employers O
are O
entitled O
to O
reimbursement O
for O
compensation O
paid O
under O
the O
Act O
(820 O
ILCS O
305/5(b) O
(West O
1992)). O
Section O
8(a) O
of O
the O
Act O
requires O
the O
employer O
to O
pay O
for O
all O

to O
cure O

the O

In O

the O

This O
case O
involved O
serious O
injuries O
and O
necessarily O
required O
involvement O
of O
various O
medical O
and O
surgical O
specialists. O
It O
does O
not O
take O
much O
involvement O
with O
the O
busy O
schedules O
of O
medical O
specialists O
to O
realize O
the O
limited O
time O
spent O
with O
different O
patients. O
What O
we O
have O
here O
, O
with O
the O
use O
of O
Nancy O
Peck O
, O
appears O
comparable O
to O
the O
services O
of O
the O
country O
doctor O
who O
took O
time O
to O
counsel O
with O
, O
and O
psychologically O
assist O
, O
his O
or O
her O
patients O
. O
Often O
both O
spouses O
are O
employed. O
In O
cases O
similar O
to O
this O
, O
home O
care O
has O
its O
limitations O
due O
to O
the O
absence O
of O
the O
other O
head O
of O
household. O
This O
, O
with O
the O
absence O
of O
house O
visits O
by O
physicians O
, O
creates O
a O
greater O
demand O
for O
the O
specialty O
exemplified O
by O
Nancy O
Peck. O
We O
conclude O
the O
service O
falls O
within O
the O
requirement O
for O
instruction O
and O
training O
necessary O
for O
the O
physical O
, O
mental O
, O
and O
vocational O
rehabilitation O
. O
In O
reaching O
the O
decision O
, O
we O
recognize O
the O
entry O
into O
uncharted O
waters. O
We O
also O
recognize O
that O
compensation O
carriers O
are O
aware O
, O
when O
they O
provide O
these O
services O
, O
that O
reimbursement O
may O
well O
not O
be O
forthcoming. O
This O
, O
in O
itself O
, O
will O
police O
the O
abuse O
of O
providing O
the O
services. O
The O
evidence O
in O
this O
case O
establishes O
the O
services O
were O
basically O
for O
the O
benefit O
of O
David O
and O
, O
indirectly O
, O
Sherry O
Cole O
, O
rather O
than O
Community O

JUSTICE O
GREEN O
, O
specially O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
majority O
that O
, O
as O
a O
matter O
of O

, O
Community O
Grain O

were O
entitled O
to O
a O

the O
sum O
of O
$12 O
, O

for O

incurred O
in O

Accordingly O
, O
I O
concur O

the O
decision O
to O
reverse O
and O
remand O
to O
have O
the O
reimbursement O
award O
increased O
by O
that O

Nevertheless O
, O
I O
am O
concerned O
because O

are O
being O
required O
to O
pay O
this O
sum O
to O
Community O

even O
though O

not O

Presumably O
, O
here O
, O
the O

could O
have O
cross-appealed O
from O
the O

them O
contending O
that O
the O

In O

because O
the O

I O
concur O

I O
do O

(Law) O
(735 O

of O

Illinois O
Department O

(DCFS) O
made O
by O
a O
letter O
from O
DCFS O
to O
plaintiff O
on O
August O
29 O
, O

In O
the O
letter O
, O
DCFS O
denied O

request O
for O

to O
the O

makes O
such O
a O
de- O
cision O
subject O
to O
judicial O
review O
under O
the O
Law. O
On O
January O
5 O
, O
1995 O
, O
after O
a O
hearing O
, O
the O
circuit O
court O
granted O
a O
motion O
to O
dismiss O
the O
complaint O
for O
want O
of O
jurisdiction. O
Plaintiff O
has O
appealed. O
We O
hold O
that O
the O
judicial O
review O
was O
properly O
before O
the O
circuit O
court O
and O
that O
the O
record O
conclusively O
shows O
that O
, O
under O
confused O
circumstances O
, O
DCFS O
had O
not O
proceeded O
properly O
and O
that O
the O
cause O
must O
be O
sent O
back O
to O
DCFS O
for O
further O
proceedings. O
Accord- O
ingly O
, O
we O
reverse O
the O
order O
dismissing O
the O
complaint O
and O
remand O
to O
the O
circuit O
court O
with O
directions O
to O
remand O
to O
DCFS O
for O
proceedings O
in O
accordance O
with O
this O
order. O
Plaintiff\u2019s O
complaint O
alleged O
that O
(1) O
she O
had O
applied O
for O
the O
license O
and O
had O
made O
all O
necessary O
filings O
with O
her O
application; O
(2) O
she O
had O
received O
the O
letter O
of O
denial; O
(3) O
the O
action O
of O
DCFS O
was O
con- O
trary O
to O
the O
laws O
of O
the O
State O
and O
denied O
her O
due O
process; O
(4) O
she O
was O
not O
afforded O
an O
opportunity O
to O
contest O
an O
"indicated\u201d O
child O
abuse O
report O
which O
was O
the O
basis O
of O
the O
denial; O
(5) O
she O
requested O
a O
reconsideration O
of O
the O
denial O
and O
was O
informed O
no O
such O
review O
was O
available; O
and O
(6) O
she O
thereby O
exhausted O
her O
administrative O
reme- O
dies. O
She O
requested O
DCFS O
be O
required O
to O
file O
an O
answer O
consisting O
of O
its O
records O
in O
the O
proceeding. O
Attached O
to O
the O
complaint O
was O
the O
letter O
of O
DCFS O
which O
denied O

, O
stating: O

Originally O
DCFS O
maintained O
that O
a O
failure O
by O
plaintiff O
to O
seek O
review O
of O
the O
"indicated O
report\u201d O
within O
the O
required O
60 O
days O
after O
she O
received O
notification O
of O
that O
document O
constituted O
a O
failure O
to O
pursue O
her O
administrative O
remedies O
requiring O
dismissal O
of O
her O
petition O
for O
judicial O
review. O
However O
, O
DCFS O
now O
agrees O
that O
the O
failure O
to O
contest O
the O
"indicated O
report\u201d O
did O
not O
necessarily O
bar O
issuance O
of O
a O
license O
and O
thus O
did O
not O
finally O
determine O
the O
issue O
before O
it. O
Rather O
, O
DCFS O
contends O
that O
plaintiff O
should O
have O
sought O
rehearing O
in O
regard O
to O
the O
letter O
of O
August O
24 O
, O
1994 O
. O
A O
certain O
amount O
of O
confusion O
seemed O
to O
exist O
in O
regard O
to O
what O
procedures O
should O
have O
been O
followed O
by O
DCFS O
upon O
plaintiff\u2019s O
request O
for O
a O
license O
and O
considering O
the O
existence O
of O
the O
"indicated O
report.\u201d O
Now O
the O
parties O
seem O
to O
be O
in O
agreement O
, O
and O
we O
hold O
that O
the O
rules O

be O
followed O
were O
those O

(Administrative O
